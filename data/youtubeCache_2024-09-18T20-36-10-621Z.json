      "title": "Defining Your Faith: Understanding Your Journey with Jesus",
      "description": "In today’s message, we explore the concept of defining your relationship with Jesus, much like having a “DTR” (Define The Relationship) conversation. Whether you’re new to faith or a long-time believer, it’s important to be honest about where you are in your spiritual journey. \n\nWe’ll discuss three stages of faith: knowing, growing, and sowing. Each stage represents a different part of your walk with God – from the excitement of discovering His love to the joy of helping others. \n\nJoin us as we reflect on the Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector from Luke 18, learning how God values honesty over comparison. This is a message for everyone, no matter where you are in your faith journey.",

      "description": "In this message, we explore three important lessons from Moses’ encounter with the burning bush. Moses was just going about his everyday life when he witnessed something extraordinary. God showed up in an unexpected way, and Moses listened. \n\nJust like with Moses, God invites us to seek Him and be ready for those “holy distractions” in our lives. When we seek God with all our hearts, we will find Him. \n\nJoin us as we dive into the importance of seeking God, recognizing His presence, and sharing His story with others.",
