      "description": "In this message, we learn how to disagree with others—especially about political issues—in a way that honors God and preserves relationships. We focus on Ephesians 4 and how to live in unity as Christians, even when we don’t see eye to eye. Whether disagreeing with non-believers or fellow Christians, we explore how to approach these moments with humility, love, and patience. Discover practical ways to navigate political conversations about immigration and the economy while staying true to your faith. Let’s remember: it’s better to keep the relationship than to win the argument.\n\nHow to Disagree in Love: Faithful Conversations on Politics and Relationships\n\nIn this message, we explore how to lovingly disagree with both non-believers and fellow Christians, especially on political issues. Using Ephesians 4, we learn how to stay united in faith, even when we have different opinions. Discover practical ways to handle disagreements while maintaining relationships, and how to use these conversations as opportunities to share the gospel. We’ll also touch on two key issues in today's political climate: immigration and the economy, with a biblical perspective on both. Join us as we grow in unity and love!",

We need to spread the Gospel to every tribe and nation.\n\nThe second angel warns us that \"Babylon\" has fallen. This means we should be careful not to get caught up in the distractions of the world. Instead, we need to keep our hearts focused on God and His love.\n\nFinally, the third angel reminds us to choose whom we will worship. God loves us so much and wants everyone to come back to Him. So let's stand firm and share this good news with everyone around us, showing love and kindness to all!\n\nJoin us as we explore these messages and learn how we can be part of spreading the Eternal Gospel!",

      "description": "In this inspiring sermon, we dive deep into what it means to have the mind of Christ and become more like Jesus. Through understanding concepts like justification and sanctification, we learn that following Jesus is a journey, not a destination. \n\nJust like a construction project or a new wardrobe, God is at work within us to reshape our hearts and minds, helping us to throw off our old ways and embrace the new. Join us as we explore how to let go of the things that hold us back and step into the beautiful life God has for us. \n\nRemember, it's not about what we can do to earn God's love—it's about accepting His free gift of grace and allowing His Spirit to guide us.",

      "description": "Have you ever faced a situation that seemed impossible, but then God showed up? In this video, we dive into the powerful story of Moses and the Israelites crossing the Red Sea and the song of praise they sang afterward. Just like them, we all have our own stories of God's faithfulness—times when He brought us through challenges and showed us His strength. \n\nJoin us as we explore how their song can inspire us to sing our own songs of faith today. Whether you're facing struggles or celebrating God's blessings, let's lift our voices together!",
