      "description": "In today’s message, we explore the concept of defining your relationship with Jesus, much like having a “DTR” (Define The Relationship) conversation. Whether you’re new to faith or a long-time believer, it’s important to be honest about where you are in your spiritual journey. \n\nWe’ll discuss three stages of faith: knowing, growing, and sowing. Each stage represents a different part of your walk with God – from the excitement of discovering His love to the joy of helping others. \n\nJoin us as we reflect on the Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector from Luke 18, learning how God values honesty over comparison. This is a message for everyone, no matter where you are in your faith journey.",

Instead, we're diving into the topic of evangelism – a word that sometimes carries a bit of baggage. Over the next three weeks, we’ll explore why evangelism is so important and how we can share our faith in a loving, relationship-focused way.\n\nToday, we'll start with the \"why\" of evangelism, followed by practical \"how-to\" steps in the coming weeks. Our goal is to empower and equip you to share the hope we have in Jesus Christ, especially as we approach the fall season and new routines begin.\n\nJoin us as we delve into the Great Commandment (Mark 12) and the Great Commission (Matthew 28) to understand our mission to love our neighbors and preach the gospel. Let’s embrace our role in spreading the good news and being good neighbors in our daily lives.\n\nThank you for being a part of our community. Let's go out and make a difference together!",

      "description": "Today’s message, \"Finding Faith and Resilience Amidst Life's Storms,\" touches on the unpredictability of life and the strength we find in faith.\n\n Despite the chaos brought by Hurricane Beryl, the message is clear: God's love remains steadfast, regardless of our circumstances. Whether you have power or are still in the dark, whether you’ve faced minor inconveniences or significant hardships, know that Jesus loves you.\n\nWe also explore the importance of avoiding bad theology in times of crisis. Our pastor warns against interpreting individual events as signs of divine favor or disfavor. Instead, we are reminded that we live in a broken world in need of redemption, and it’s through Jesus Christ that we find restoration and hope.\n\nLastly, the message calls us to examine our discipleship and the cost of following Jesus. True faith requires commitment, sacrifice, and a willingness to endure hardships. But the rewards of a life fully devoted to Christ are beyond measure.\n\nAs we navigate through these challenging times, let us be a church that supports and uplifts each other. If you need help, please reach out – you are not alone. We are here to serve and stand by you.",

      "description": "Today's message dives deep into a relatable and profound topic: reaching our breaking point. We all have moments where stress, fatigue, and frustration culminate in anger. Whether it's traffic woes, work pressures, or family challenges, these instances test our patience and resilience. In this message, we reflect on these moments and find wisdom in the story of Jesus reaching His own breaking point. We explore the powerful narrative of Jesus flipping the tables in the temple, an event recorded in all four Gospels. What made Jesus angry? How can we ensure our actions do not evoke such anger from Him?\n\nThrough the lens of Matthew 21, we examine the implications of Jesus' actions and uncover the deeper lessons about justice, compassion, and maintaining the purity of our spiritual temple. Join us as we navigate our emotions and align our lives more closely with the teachings of Christ.",

      "description": "In our spiritual journey, we often seek clarity, yet true understanding unfolds over time. The story of Jesus healing a blind man in two stages in Mark 8:22-26 illustrates the gradual process of spiritual enlightenment. Initially, the man sees people as trees walking, but with Jesus's second touch, his sight is fully restored. This teaches us that spiritual growth requires patience and that life's messiness can lead to a deeper faith. This message will guide you through the importance of patience, trust in God's timing, and the call to consecration in our spiritual growth. If you're seeking answers on how to navigate your faith journey, find inspiration here to move from uncertainty to a place of clear vision and purpose. Join us in reflecting on this transformative biblical narrative and its application to our lives today.",

Discover the biblical definition of love, rooted in the concept of agape – a selfless, sacrificial love that mirrors God's love for us. Learn why love is not just a sentiment but a choice, a pursuit, and a commitment. Gain insights into the profound nature of God's love and understand why receiving His love is crucial for a fulfilled life.",

For children, this season is\nmarked by presents wrapped under the tree, and over the next four weeks, we’ll see how Jesus’ birth is a gift to our weary world. Because God put on flesh and was born in a manger in Bethlehem, we receive the gifts of hope, joy, peace and love. Whether this season is filled with wonder or filled with weariness for you, we’re glad that you’ve joined us at Loft!",

      "description": "In this sermon, Pastor Daniel Lumpee wraps up our four-week series called \"The Good Fight\" talking about finding true contentment. We've been learning from Paul's instructions to young Timothy about how to shine the light of Jesus in a dark world and fight the good fight of faith. 💪\n\nWe discovered that the weapons for this spiritual battle might not be what we expected. Instead of physical tools, Paul points to essential qualities like rejecting false teaching, the power of prayer, and living out the Gospel in our actions. Today, we focused on the weapon of \"Contentment.\" 🛡️\n\nBeing content means finding joy and peace in what we have, rather than constantly desiring more. It's about realizing that true happiness isn't in wealth or possessions but in Jesus Christ. \n\nWe also discussed how comparison can rob us of contentment and how having an eternal perspective helps us focus on what truly matters. And guess what? Being generous with our hearts and giving of ourselves also leads to contentment! \n\nSo, let's remember to fix our eyes on Jesus, surrender to Him, and trust that He will make what we have enough. With Jesus on our side, we can face any challenge and fight the good fight! \n\n🔔 Remember to subscribe and hit the notification bell to join our church community!\n🙌 Share this video with friends and family who love God's Word!",

He defines worship as \"the way in which we glorify God and enjoy him forever.\" He then goes on to say that worship is not about our actions, but about our hearts. He challenges us to find a reason to praise God every time we walk into church, even if it is something as simple as having breath in our lungs. encourage you to find a way to worship God today. It doesn't have to be anything fancy or elaborate. Just take some time to tell God how much you love him and thank him for all he has done for you. You will be glad you did!\n\n#worship #worshipmusic #praiseandworship #whatisworship",

      "description": "In this inspiring message, Karen shares her personal faith journey and emphasizes the importance of forgiveness. She highlights that as Christians, we don't have to be perfect because we have a heavenly Father who fills the gaps with His love and grace. Karen encourages us to stay surrendered to Jesus, live a life of prayer, and embrace the gift of forgiveness. She explains the three steps to give the gift of forgiveness: forgiving the person who hurt us, praying for them, and blessing them. Through forgiveness, we can experience healing, freedom, and a changed heart. The message reminds us of Jesus' ultimate sacrifice and the power of forgiveness that comes from His love. Let us embrace forgiveness and walk in the freedom it brings.\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/loft\nChurch Online: https://loftchurch.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/LoftChurch\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/LoftChurch\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #forgiveness",

We celebrate the historical fact that Jesus’ tomb was empty and that He is risen. And because Jesus is risen, when you receive Him into your life, the power of the resurrected Christ lives in you. Easter promises us that if Jesus is our Lord, we can experience abundant life on this side of the grave, and eternal life forevermore. We’re so grateful you are celebrating with us today, and we hope to see you again soon.

This Lent, we’ll be focusing on our need to repent, to turn from our sinful ways and back to God. Each week we’ll look at the message from a different Minor Prophet and learn modern, practical lessons about what it means to return to God.

      "description": "What do we believe about relationships? Jesus said in John 14, “I am the way, the truth, and the life.” Jesus — our Messiah and our Savior — is also the source of all truth. We can turn to Him for all of life’s big questions. That’s what we’re doing in this series we’ve called “TinderBox.” We know that the world sends us all kinds of messages about relationships, and if we’re not careful, we can believe society’s lies. During this series, we’ll be looking at what God’s Word has to say about our relationships so that we can battle the world’s lies with God’s truth. Whether you're single or in a relationship, this video is a great way to look at relationships from a different perspective and get some helpful advice in the process!\n\nLoft Worship | Daniel Lumpee\n\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/loft\nChurch Online: https://loftchurch.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/LoftChurch\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/LoftChurch\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #tinderbox #thegrassisgreener #comparison",

We can turn to Him for all of life’s big questions. That’s what we’re doing in this series we’ve called “TinderBox.” We know that the world sends us all kinds of messages about relationships, and if we’re not careful, we can believe society’s lies. During this series, we’ll be looking at what God’s Word has to say about our relationships so that we can battle the world’s lies with God’s truth.\n\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/loft\nChurch Online: https://loftchurch.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/LoftChurch\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/LoftChurch\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #tinderbox",

      "description": "As we continue our series on Acts, we're looking at Paul's unwavering commitment to spreading the Gospel, even when faced with imprisonment and persecution. His resolve to appeal to Caesar rather than taking the easier route back to Jerusalem is a testament to his faith and dedication.\n\nWe'll also reflect on the challenges of sharing our faith, drawing inspiration from the parable of the sower in Mark 4. This parable reminds us that while not every seed we plant will grow, our efforts are never in vain. Whether the seed falls on rocky ground, among thorns, or fertile soil, our job is to continue planting and trusting God to bring the increase.\n\nSharing our faith can be difficult, and it's natural to feel discouraged when our efforts don't seem to bear fruit. However, we must remember that God can work through every situation. Just as the farmer in the parable doesn't give up, we too must keep sowing seeds of hope, love, and faith.\n\nThank you for being part of our church family. We look forward to seeing you next week as we continue to explore the incredible stories and lessons from the book of Acts.",

Thomas shares a fascinating story about how Peter, one of Jesus' closest friends, had a dream that changed everything. People back then thought the good news about Jesus was only for a certain group, but Peter's dream showed that God's love is for everyone. It's like a big invitation to a party, and no one is left out! You'll be encouraged to be like Peter, to share God's love with everyone and remember that God's love can empower us to do amazing things.",

Join us as we delve into the Book of Acts, a narration of the early church's journey, to understand the lessons it holds for us today. Just like Saul's story, this is our story too, and we can learn valuable insights from the early church's experiences.\n\nLast week, we had our Mission Sunday, emphasizing the importance of missions in our community and around the world. Learn how you can participate in various ways - from praying for missions to making pledges for the missions offering. Join us as we uncover the power of faith and transformation.\n\nIn this passage, we witness Saul's encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus, a life-altering moment that changed him from a persecutor to a believer. We also highlight the significance of advocacy and encouragement, exemplified by Barnabas, and how it can profoundly impact lives.\n\nAs we explore the message further, let's reflect on how we can be agents of positive change and encouragement in the lives of those around us. Join us on this spiritual journey through Acts, and may you be inspired to make a difference in your community.\n\nDon't forget to subscribe, like, and share this video to help us spread the message.

In the first part of the message, we talk about what it means to be resilient and how the disciples' deep sense of belovedness empowered them to bounce back in the face of challenges. We also highlight the importance of living out our faith with joy, gratitude, and empathy.\n\nIn the second part, we delve into specific stories from Acts Chapter 5, including the intriguing tale of Ananias and Sapphira. We explore how truth-telling, testimony sharing, and authentic community-building were key components of the early Christian experience.\n\nSo, whether you're a long-time believer or just curious about Christianity, there's something here for you. Join us on this journey of discovering what it means to be a resilient Christian in a world that often lacks wholeheartedness.\n\nLike this message?

      "description": "Join us on a journey through the book of Romans, where we learn about the teachings of the Apostle Paul. In this chapter, Romans 4, we delve into the story of Abraham and explore the concept of righteousness through faith. We discover that Paul's writings in Romans are influenced by his encounter with Jesus, which transformed his life. By reading Romans with the lens of Jesus' grace and love, we gain a new understanding of God's promises and how they relate to our lives today.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n-Paul's letters, including Romans, were written after his encounter with Jesus, and they reflect his understanding of God's grace.\n-We have an advantage as believers because we know God's promises and have access to His Word.\n-Everyone, including Abraham, has sinned and fallen short of God's glory. However, through faith, we can be justified by God's grace.\n-Abraham's story teaches us the importance of having hope and unwavering faith in God's promises, even when circumstances seem impossible.\n-The promises made to Abraham and David in the Bible can give us confidence that God is faithful and will fulfill His promises in our lives too.\n-Taking steps of faith and believing in God's power can lead to righteousness and a deeper relationship with Him.\n\nJoin us as we explore the book of Romans, uncovering God's promises, and understanding how they can impact our lives today.\n\n\nWeb: https://www.twmc.org/woodforest\nChurch Online: https://woodforest.online.church/",

By embracing God’s love, we find peace, purpose, and the ultimate reward — a life that reflects Jesus. \n\nLet’s grow together in love and wisdom as we live out God’s calling.",

      "description": "We often equate wisdom with knowledge or age, but true wisdom goes beyond that. Biblical wisdom is about understanding God's will and living accordingly. King Solomon, who wrote much of the wisdom literature in the Bible, teaches us that wisdom begins with a reverence for God. Worldly wisdom may lead us astray, but Godly wisdom guides us to a life full of peace, love, and eternal joy.\n\nJoin us as we contrast Godly and worldly wisdom. From the rich young ruler's struggle to let go of his wealth, to Martha and Mary's different approaches to hosting Jesus, to our own life's choices. Life presents us with decisions, big and small, shaping who we are. By seeking Godly wisdom, we make better choices, deepen our relationship with Jesus, and reflect His love and grace.\n\nLet's commit to seeking wisdom from above, making it our highest priority, and trusting that it will lead us to true life in Christ.",

This encounter by the sea is a pivotal moment, reminding us of the significance of seeking God, no matter the time or place. Through the lens of John 21, we delve into how Jesus' simple breakfast with His disciples was more than a meal – it was a moment of restoration, reaffirmation, and a call to continue the mission He set forth.\n\nOur sermon reflects on how we, like the disciples, may find ourselves drifting away from our spiritual commitments but are always called back by Jesus. The breakfast by the sea symbolizes a new beginning, a restoration of faith, and a reminder that Jesus never forsakes us.",

      "title": "[Full Service] Finding God in the Quiet Places: Prayer",
      "description": "Traditional Worship | March 3, 2024 | Rev. Margarita McCarthy\n\nThe season of Lent has its roots in the 40 days Jesus spent fasting and being tempted in the wilderness. Just as Christ relied on the Word of God to sustain Him, we, too, must use this season to nourish our souls as we experience our own temptations. One way for us to prepare ourselves and be ready for the great festival of the resurrection of Christ, which Easter celebrates, is to find God in the quiet places along our own Lenten journey. The prophet Isaiah wrote, “Seek the Lord while he may be found; call upon him while he is near.” In this holy, 40-day season, our sermon series is designed to help us seek and find God in the tranquil and peaceful places where we, like Christ, can be victorious over all those things that separate us from God. We are delighted you have joined us for our Lenten journey.\n\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #thatsourchurch #ourchurch #findinggod #quietplaces #prayer",

      "description": "There is an unexplainable mystery that proclaims the seasons of Advent and Christmas, a story so steeped in simplicity and awe that it transcends everything we thought we knew about the God we serve. Mankind has always sought God in many unusual ways, but the Christmas story is about God\npursuing us, and on the night a child was born in the city of Bethlehem, God found us. Since then, our world has not been the same. Prophets, angels, shepherds and wise men heralded the good news,\nand their message declared the greatest wonder of all: “Emmanuel — God is with us!” It is a story that never grows old, and we are delighted you are here to experience Advent and Christmas once again and to celebrate The Wonder of It All.",

      "description": "Our current sermon series, “When God Says No,” continues this week as we are taken to the Garden of Gethsemane to hear Jesus’ words of agony: “Take this cup from me.” \n\nWhat is the cup that Jesus refers to, and why would He make such a request of His Heavenly Father? But what is even more puzzling is why would God not grant permission in the final hours of His only Son’s life? These are the questions that we will address in this message - the answers might surprise you! Join us as we reflect on the significance of Jesus' sacrifice and learn to understand what it means when God says no to our requests.",

      "description": "Today, we continue our series, \"Survival of the Fittest,\" where we explore the Book of Romans, digging into faith, righteousness, and what it means to be spiritually fit. Last week, we talked about righteous judgment. This week, we'll delve deeper into faith, a crucial aspect of our spiritual journey.\n\nBut here's a little story for you! While Bishop Hayes was preparing this sermon, he stumbled upon a hidden treasure - a clay coaster with a profound quote: \"Faith is to believe what you do not yet see; the reward for faith is to see what you believe.\" 🙌✨ Talk about a God moment!\n\nSo, what does faith mean to you? How large is your faith? 🤔 Today, we'll explore these questions and dive into the incredible faith journey of Abraham, as explained by the Apostle Paul in Romans.\n\nAs we go through this message, remember that faith isn't just about believing in Jesus; it's about trusting in His promises, even in the face of adversity. When we embrace suffering and affirm the resurrection, our faith expands, making us more like Christ.\n\nSo, join us as we explore faith, hope, and God's incredible love in today's sermon. Don't forget to like, share, and subscribe to our channel for more inspiring content. \n\n🔔 Stay tuned for more uplifting messages and worship services!

      "description": "Traditional Worship | Bishop Bob Hayes   \n\nThere is a road that begins on Ash Wednesday and ends at Easter—it is called Lent. It is a 40-day journey that invites us to enter into a deeper relationship with God as we remember the sacrifice Jesus made on our behalf which led Him to the cross on a hill called Calvary. Lent is a solemn and holy season, and travel along this road demands something of us, for it is only through prayer, confession, self-examination and sacrifice that we can arrive at that destination where we fully understand the hidden possibilities that lie dormant within each of us. This road trip can become the most important journey we will ever take, for it summons us to die unto our sins so we may celebrate the Resurrection and the promise of eternal life with the One who died for us and gave Himself as a living sacrifice for all. \n\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/  \n\nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/ \n\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist \n\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist \n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #roadtrip #lent #lent2023 #roadtoconfession #confession",

Imagine a world where every tear is wiped away, and death is no more. In this Revelation, we find the promise of Jesus' return, bringing hope and renewal.\n\nIn this 14-week series, leading up to Thanksgiving, Pastor Mark will guide us through the final book of the Bible, helping us understand its profound messages and how they apply to our lives today. We'll dive into the narratives, symbols, and prophecies, uncovering the deeper meanings and preparing our hearts and minds for the triumphant return of our King.\n\nWhether you're new to studying Revelation or have journeyed through it before, this series aims to reframe and demystify its messages, encouraging us to live out our faith with renewed passion and purpose. Revelation is not about predicting the future but preparing for it, reminding us that we are on the welcoming committee for Jesus' return, not the planning committee.\n\nJoin us each week as we lift our eyes and hearts to the hope found in Jesus Christ, embracing the joyous promise of His eternal glory and unending peace. Don't miss this opportunity to deepen your understanding and strengthen your faith.",

In this heartfelt discussion, we reflect on the culmination of recent events, including the conclusion of our Shabbat series and the launch of Bristol House's first album. We also share insights from the New Room Conference and explore the significance of taking time to rest, connect, and listen to the heartbeat of God.\n\nOur pastors and worship leaders open up about their own experiences and challenges in observing Sabbath. We also learn about the power of worship songs and how they can deeply impact our spiritual journey.\n\nDiscover the importance of giving away what you have to offer, as we discuss the vulnerability and beauty of sharing our unique gifts within the church community. We conclude with a meaningful communion service, reminding us of Jesus's sacrifice and our call to be a fragrance of love and light in the world.",

      "title": "Embracing the Radical Mission of God for a More Meaningful Life - Carolyn Moore",
      "description": "In this powerful message about the living life on mission with God, Carolyn Moore encourages us to challenge the status quo and calls us to live beyond the limitations and expectations of culture. When we live life on mission with God we are invited into a deeper, more meaningful existence, to a life of purpose and fulfillment that goes beyond the superficial and fleeting pleasures that culture offers. \n\nCulture, on the other hand, is often driven by the pursuit of self-gratification, instant gratification, and the accumulation of wealth and power. It is a message that often celebrates and reinforces the values of consumerism, individualism, and hedonism, promoting a lifestyle that is often marked by materialism, superficiality, and emptiness. \n\nThe mission of God, however, offers us an alternative to this way of living. It calls us to a life of service, sacrifice, and love, to a life of compassion and generosity towards others. It invites us to embrace a more holistic perspective on life, one that recognizes the interconnectedness of all things, and the sacredness of all life. \n\nIn a world that is increasingly consumed by the culture of self, the message of God offers us a way out of the trap of materialism and self-centeredness. It calls us to transcend our narrow interests and pursue a higher purpose, one that is rooted in the pursuit of justice, compassion, and love for all. \n\nIn short, the radical mission of God offers us a better way of living, one that is more meaningful, more fulfilling, and ultimately more satisfying than the message of culture. It is a mission that invites us to be agents of change in a world that desperately needs it, and to be a light in the darkness, bringing hope, healing, and love to all those around us. \n\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/harvest \nChurch Online: https://harvesttwumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/HarvestTWMC \nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/HarvestTWMC\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #radical #breakthrough #radicalmission",

Having radical faith through the Holy Spirit is a transformative experience that can turn your life upside down in the best possible way. It means abandoning yourself to the power and guidance of the Holy Spirit, and allowing yourself to be moved by the divine force of love that flows through all of creation. \n\nWith radical faith, you can move mountains and accomplish the impossible. You become fearless in the face of adversity, knowing that you are not alone but accompanied by the Holy Spirit who gives you strength and wisdom to overcome any obstacle. \n\nRadical faith through the Holy Spirit also means living a life of joy and purpose. It means finding your true calling and living it out with passion and conviction, knowing that you are doing the work of God and making a positive impact on the world. \n\nIt's not always an easy path, but having radical faith through the Holy Spirit is a journey worth taking. It will challenge you, transform you, and ultimately lead you to a deeper connection with God and a life filled with meaning and purpose. So if you're ready to step out in faith and experience the power of the Holy Spirit, get ready for a wild and wonderful ride! \n\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/harvest \nChurch Online: https://harvesttwumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/HarvestTWMC \nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/HarvestTWMC\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #radical #radicalfaith",

The power of Jesus was proved through His resurrection, so we find the promise of new life through faith in Christ. We’re not perfect. In fact, we like to say we are perfectly imperfect, but we’re loved by a perfect Father. If you are looking for a place to explore or grow your faith with other imperfect people, we would love to tell you more about our church.\n\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/harvest \nChurch Online: https://harvesttwumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/HarvestTWMC \nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/HarvestTWMC\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #radical #radicalvision",

This encounter by the sea is a pivotal moment, reminding us of the significance of seeking God, no matter the time or place. Through the lens of John 21, we delve into how Jesus' simple breakfast with His disciples was more than a meal – it was a moment of restoration, reaffirmation, and a call to continue the mission He set forth.\n\nOur sermon reflects on how we, like the disciples, may find ourselves drifting away from our spiritual commitments but are always called back by Jesus. The breakfast by the sea symbolizes a new beginning, a restoration of faith, and a reminder that Jesus never forsakes us.",

Just as the disciples faced turbulent seas and found solace in Jesus, we too encounter storms in life where our faith is tested. As we navigate through these challenging times, remember that Jesus is our eternal lifeguard, ready to save us when we call out to him.\n\nJoin us as we explore the significance of having a lifeguard for our faith, the importance of reaching out to Jesus in our weakest moments, and the comfort of knowing that he is always there to rescue us from the depths of despair. Let's come together in prayer, reflection, and worship, and find strength in the presence of our Savior.",

It’s so easy to get caught up in the busyness of this season that we can miss the beauty of it all. That’s why this Advent, we’re seeking to recapture the childlike wonder of Christmas. For children, this season is\nmarked by presents wrapped under the tree, and over the next four weeks, we’ll see how Jesus’ birth is a gift to our weary world. Because God put on flesh and was born in a manger in Bethlehem, we receive the gifts of hope, joy, peace and love. Whether this season is filled with wonder or filled with weariness for you, we’re glad that you’ve joined us at Loft!",

Mankind has always sought God in many unusual ways, but the Christmas story is about God\npursuing us, and on the night a child was born in the city of Bethlehem, God found us. Since then, our world has not been the same. Prophets, angels, shepherds and wise men heralded the good news,\nand their message declared the greatest wonder of all: “Emmanuel — God is with us!” It is a story that never grows old, and we are delighted you are here to experience Advent and Christmas once again and to celebrate The Wonder of It All.",

      "description": "Today, we continue our series, \"Survival of the Fittest,\" where we explore the Book of Romans, digging into faith, righteousness, and what it means to be spiritually fit. Last week, we talked about righteous judgment. This week, we'll delve deeper into faith, a crucial aspect of our spiritual journey.\n\nBut here's a little story for you! While Bishop Hayes was preparing this sermon, he stumbled upon a hidden treasure - a clay coaster with a profound quote: \"Faith is to believe what you do not yet see; the reward for faith is to see what you believe.\" 🙌✨ Talk about a God moment!\n\nSo, what does faith mean to you? How large is your faith? 🤔 Today, we'll explore these questions and dive into the incredible faith journey of Abraham, as explained by the Apostle Paul in Romans.\n\nAs we go through this message, remember that faith isn't just about believing in Jesus; it's about trusting in His promises, even in the face of adversity. When we embrace suffering and affirm the resurrection, our faith expands, making us more like Christ.\n\nSo, join us as we explore faith, hope, and God's incredible love in today's sermon. Don't forget to like, share, and subscribe to our channel for more inspiring content. \n\n🔔 Stay tuned for more uplifting messages and worship services! God bless you all. 🙏\n\n#romans #survivalofthefittest #faith #faithhopeandlove",

      "description": "Traditional Worship | Bishop Bob Hayes  \n\nWhen we use the term “model citizen,” we most often think of a person living an exemplary life, possessing such qualities as honesty, integrity and truth. Individuals who demonstrate these characteristics usually stand out in a crowd and are easily recognized. However, the New Testament is full of model citizens who walked in Jesus’ footsteps but were not always given the notoriety many other disciples received. Not only were they strong in their faith, but their influence and contribution to the early church was significant. This sermon series reveals a few lesser-known followers of our Lord who serve as an inspiration to us, reminding us that we all have unique gifts to offer as we walk in the footsteps of Christ.\n\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #modelcitizen #josephofarimathea #secretdisciple",

The book is a letter written by the Apostle Paul to Philemon, a fellow Christian, about forgiveness and the relationship between a master and a slave. However, the story of Philemon is important because it reveals the nature of God, forgiveness, and the inherent dignity and respect for all humanity. Philemon is a model citizen who shows that forgiveness can only be found when one follows Christ. The book is also a reminder that we should treat everyone with respect and dignity. Overall, the book of Philemon teaches us important lessons about forgiveness, respect, and treating others as equals.\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #modelcitizen #philemon #brotherinchrist",

      "description": "Traditional Worship\n \nThere is a road that leads from Ash Wednesday to Easter, and it is called Lent. It is the 40-day journey that enables us to enter into a deeper relationship with God as we remember the sacrifice Jesus made on our behalf that ended at the cross on a hill called Calvary. It is a solemn and holy season, symbolized by the ashes that remind us of our own mortality\nand our need to deny ourselves and follow Him. Travel along this road demands something of us. It is only through prayer, confession, self-examination and sacrifice that we are able to arrive at that destination where we fully understand the hidden possibilities that lie dormant within each of us. The Scriptures remind us “from dust we came, and to dust we shall return.” Come, journey with us as we die unto our sins so we may celebrate the resurrection and the promise of eternal life with the One who died for us and gave Himself as a living sacrifice for all.",

      "description": "Traditional Worship | Rev. Dr. Jeff Olive  \n\nThroughout Jesus’ ministry, one remarkable truth stands out: He never imposed Himself upon any of the people He encountered. Jesus recognized the fact that God gave human beings free will and, in doing so, gave them the freedom to choose to abide in the true love of God or continue in another direction. In several instances Jesus is quoted as saying, “As you wish” or “As you choose,” knowing that the choices that are made can be the first step toward change. But when our wishes and choices take precedence over God’s plan for us, the consequences can be destructive. This sermon series will focus on us making the right choices that will help us abide in the true love God offers us.\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #asyouwish #abiding",

      "description": "In this message, we explore the final chapter of Acts, discovering how silence and reflection can bring us closer to God. Pastor Brent guides us through the practice of Lectio Divina – an ancient way of praying with Scripture – to help us open our hearts and minds to the Lord. \n\nAs we journey with Paul to the end of Acts, we learn the importance of listening to God, embracing His word, and understanding the role of the Church in God’s plan. Whether you’re facing storms in your life or simply seeking a deeper connection with God, this message offers hope and encouragement. \n\nJoin us as we learn to see with new eyes, hear with new ears, and soften our hearts to the voice of the Holy Spirit.",

      "description": "As we continue our series on Acts, we're looking at Paul's unwavering commitment to spreading the Gospel, even when faced with imprisonment and persecution. His resolve to appeal to Caesar rather than taking the easier route back to Jerusalem is a testament to his faith and dedication.\n\nWe'll also reflect on the challenges of sharing our faith, drawing inspiration from the parable of the sower in Mark 4. This parable reminds us that while not every seed we plant will grow, our efforts are never in vain. Whether the seed falls on rocky ground, among thorns, or fertile soil, our job is to continue planting and trusting God to bring the increase.\n\nSharing our faith can be difficult, and it's natural to feel discouraged when our efforts don't seem to bear fruit. However, we must remember that God can work through every situation. Just as the farmer in the parable doesn't give up, we too must keep sowing seeds of hope, love, and faith.\n\nThank you for being part of our church family. We look forward to seeing you next week as we continue to explore the incredible stories and lessons from the book of Acts.",

Despite the hardships Paul faced in prison, he remained committed to God’s call to go to Rome. Thomas encourages us to embrace desperation for God, like Paul and other biblical figures, to bring about true change in the world. \n\nJoin us in this journey of faith and discover how choosing God over comfort can transform our lives and our communities.",

      "description": "Are you living a Spirit-filled life or just going through the motions? Discover how the Holy Spirit can transform your daily walk with God, confront your idols, and lead you to true spiritual freedom. Learn about the significant shift from John's baptism—a symbol of repentance—to the baptism of Jesus, which beckons the Holy Spirit to initiate profound internal change. Reflect on your own spiritual practices: Are they merely weekly rituals, or do they represent a daily, devoted walk with God? Witness the profound influence of the Holy Spirit in Ephesus, as seen in Acts 19, where Paul's ministry brought about healing and challenged idolatry, showcasing the Spirit's enduring power to transform lives. This video encourages viewers to identify and confront the idols in their own lives, inviting the Holy Spirit to guide daily routines, decisions, and interactions. Embrace the call to a deeper, more impactful spiritual life, filled with the Holy Spirit's guidance and marked by Jesus's love and truth.",

Thomas shares a fascinating story about how Peter, one of Jesus' closest friends, had a dream that changed everything. People back then thought the good news about Jesus was only for a certain group, but Peter's dream showed that God's love is for everyone. It's like a big invitation to a party, and no one is left out! You'll be encouraged to be like Peter, to share God's love with everyone and remember that God's love can empower us to do amazing things.",

      "description": "In today's message, we explore the fascinating transformation of Saul, a persecutor of early Christians who became one of the most influential figures in the early church. Join us as we delve into the Book of Acts, a narration of the early church's journey, to understand the lessons it holds for us today. Just like Saul's story, this is our story too, and we can learn valuable insights from the early church's experiences.\n\nLast week, we had our Mission Sunday, emphasizing the importance of missions in our community and around the world. Learn how you can participate in various ways - from praying for missions to making pledges for the missions offering. Join us as we uncover the power of faith and transformation.\n\nIn this passage, we witness Saul's encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus, a life-altering moment that changed him from a persecutor to a believer. We also highlight the significance of advocacy and encouragement, exemplified by Barnabas, and how it can profoundly impact lives.\n\nAs we explore the message further, let's reflect on how we can be agents of positive change and encouragement in the lives of those around us. Join us on this spiritual journey through Acts, and may you be inspired to make a difference in your community.\n\nDon't forget to subscribe, like, and share this video to help us spread the message.

      "description": "Join us on a journey through the book of Romans, where we learn about the teachings of the Apostle Paul. In this chapter, Romans 4, we delve into the story of Abraham and explore the concept of righteousness through faith. We discover that Paul's writings in Romans are influenced by his encounter with Jesus, which transformed his life. By reading Romans with the lens of Jesus' grace and love, we gain a new understanding of God's promises and how they relate to our lives today.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n-Paul's letters, including Romans, were written after his encounter with Jesus, and they reflect his understanding of God's grace.\n-We have an advantage as believers because we know God's promises and have access to His Word.\n-Everyone, including Abraham, has sinned and fallen short of God's glory. However, through faith, we can be justified by God's grace.\n-Abraham's story teaches us the importance of having hope and unwavering faith in God's promises, even when circumstances seem impossible.\n-The promises made to Abraham and David in the Bible can give us confidence that God is faithful and will fulfill His promises in our lives too.\n-Taking steps of faith and believing in God's power can lead to righteousness and a deeper relationship with Him.\n\nJoin us as we explore the book of Romans, uncovering God's promises, and understanding how they can impact our lives today.\n\n\nWeb: https://www.twmc.org/woodforest\nChurch Online: https://woodforest.online.church/",

      "description": "Join us as we embark on a journey through the book of Romans, exploring each chapter and uncovering what Paul had to say to the early church that is still relevant to us today. In this first chapter, we discuss the importance of community and being a part of the church, and how it can strengthen us as a collective force. We also set some ground rules for our study and ask for patience as we navigate this thick, theologically dense book that has informed much of Christendom. Let's dive into the first chapter of Romans together and discover what it means for us today.\n\n\nWeb: https://www.twmc.org/woodforest\nChurch Online: https://woodforest.online.church/\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #bookofromans #romans1",

      "description": "Traditional Worship | Bishop Bob Hayes  \n\nThroughout Jesus’ ministry, one remarkable truth stands out: He never imposed Himself upon any of the people He encountered. Jesus recognized the fact that God gave human beings free will and, in doing so, gave them the freedom to choose to abide in the true love of God or continue in another direction. In several instances Jesus is quoted as saying, “As you wish” or “As you choose,” knowing that the choices that are made can be the first step toward change. But when our wishes and choices take precedence over God’s plan for us, the consequences can be destructive. This sermon series will focus on us making the right choices that will help us abide in the true love God offers us.\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #asyouwish",

We believe that our church, The Woodlands Methodist Church, is an incredible force for reaching people for Jesus, discipling them in faith, and helping those in need — and we’re proud of the work that God is doing through us! We love to say, “That’s my church!” and that’s what we’ll be talking about to begin the new year. If you’re a guest with us, we hope that you’ll be a part of this movement of God, and we’re glad that you’re with us today!\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/loft\nChurch Online: https://loftchurch.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/LoftChurch\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/LoftChurch\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #thatsmychurch #stewardship #visionweekend #visionsunday #vision2023",

      "description": "Traditional Worship | Rev. Luann Riley  \n\nIn biblical times a seal and an insignia were often used to identify and protect anything confidential or of value. The seal specified to whom it belonged, preventing anyone else from tampering with its contents. In the book of Ephesians, the Apostle Paul compares the Holy Spirit to a seal, saying: “Having believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession.” Once a soul has trusted in Christ, that soul is sealed and made secure in Him. In this sermon series, we will focus on the promises made on our behalf, given to us through the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, all of which have been Signed, Sealed and Delivered!\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #grow #growtogether #eyesonjesus",

In this sermon series, we will focus on the promises made on our behalf, given to us through the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, all of which have been Signed, Sealed and Delivered!\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #grow #growtogether #sufferingisnotforever",

      "description": "Traditional Worship | Rev. Drew Essen  \n\nThe word “faith” has many meanings, but because we live in a world where most people have to “see” in order to “believe,” the idea of having faith in something for which there is no proof is difficult to accept. However, the New Testament book of Hebrews tells us that “faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.” Jesus knew that faith was a gift from God that requires a human response. In this sermon series we will look at the stories of how faith allows us to believe in the unbelievable and make the impossible possible.\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #grow #growtogether #faith #believetheunbelievable #healingfaith",

      "description": "Traditional Worship | Rev. Drew Essen  \n\nWe now find ourselves in the season of Advent, a four-week period of preparation that culminates in the birth of Jesus. It should be a time of excitement and joy, of laughter and merriment. But for many, this season is a time of sadness, emptiness and frustration. Life should be wonderful, but how can it be when so many things take us away from the real joy of Christmas? How do we find light in the darkness, peace amid chaos and good news in a bad-news world? In this sermon series, “It’s (Not Always) a Wonderful Life,” we will rediscover the hope that comes from the faithful promises of God to bring peace through our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #grow #growtogether #itsnotalwaysawonderfullife",

Just as He called His first disciples to leave their nets and go with Him today, Jesus’ call is the same. He summons us to leave behind and let go of our busy and chaotic lives. He teaches us, empowers us, and offers us an opportunity to receive His salvation and go where He leads. Christ was always moving forward, and so must we. “Follow me” is still the call to abundant life, and it is our prayer we will accept His invitation to live out our faith and learn to extend the gifts He gives to others.\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #grow #growtogether #invitation #followme",

He healed the blind and the leper, He offered living water, and He gave us salvation and eternal life through His death on the cross. This week we welcome Rev.

As we offer it to others here and around the world, we are living and leaving a legacy of hope.\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #grow #growtogether #faith #legacyofhope #missions",

He teaches us, empowers us, and offers us an opportunity to receive His salvation and go where He leads. Christ was always moving forward, and so must we. “Follow me” is still the call to abundant life, and it is our prayer we will accept His invitation to live out our faith and learn to extend the gifts He gives to others.\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #grow #growtogether #invitation #followme",

The reality is, we are singing people, and music, as seen throughout the Bible, trains us in the practice of remembering who God is and what God has done for us. In the book of Psalms, we are encouraged to “Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all his wonderful acts” (105:2).

We celebrate the historical fact that Jesus’ tomb was empty and that He is risen. And because Jesus is risen, when you receive Him into your life, the power of the resurrected Christ lives in you. Easter promises us that if Jesus is our Lord, we can experience abundant life on this side of the grave, and eternal life forevermore. We’re so grateful you are celebrating with us today, and we hope to see you again soon.

During this Advent season, we invite you to join us as we begin a journey that will help us find what we are looking for, and our search ends at a cradle in Bethlehem where our Savior Jesus Christ is born! \n \nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/  \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/ \nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist \nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist \n \n \n#onlinechurch #livechurch #ignite #ourhopeforthefuture #searchingforchristmas #christmas #advent",

      "description": "Traditional Worship | Bishop Bob Hayes\n\nOur Christmas Eve worship services are some of the most cherished and beautiful gatherings in the life of our church. These services signal that we have reached our limits with the busyness of the season—the gift buying is over, our families are together, and we can finally focus on celebrating the birth of our Savior, Jesus Christ! This Christmas Eve, we go in search of the light that illumines our world and our lives, and our presence here tonight proclaims that no matter how dismal things may be, the light of Christ shines in the midst of our darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #ignite #ourhopeforthefuture #searchingforchristmas #christmas",

      "description": "Traditional Worship | Rev. Susan Kent\n\nIsaiah is one of the greatest Old Testament prophets of the Bible. His name literally means, “The Lord is my salvation,” and he was called to be a prophet. Into this role stepped a sinful and ill-prepared servant who caught a glimpse of One so holy that when asked, “Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?” the servant Isaiah said, “Here am I! Send me!” In this series, we will hear his message in relation to our own lives. God still callas and commissions us to bring glory and praise to Him.\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #ignite #ourhopeforthefuture #worship #hereiam #sendme #servantofthelord",

      "description": "Traditional Worship | Rev. Susan Kent\n\nThe 40-day season of Lent is a time when Christians all over the world renew their loyalty to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ through acts of repentance. The word Lent means “spring,” and it signals the reawakening of our souls, of God’s renewing love that breaks through our waywardness and sins. For us to get to the glorious resurrection that awaits us, there are doors to open so this sacred season can have meaning and purpose. Our series, Doors to Open, is an opportunity for us to enter into the new life that awaits us, for “if anyone is in Christ, they are a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!” (2 Corinthians 5:17)\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #grow #growtogether #lentendoors #lent #doorstoopen",

      "description": "Traditional Worship | Rev. Susan Kent\n\nWilliam Shakespeare asked the famous question, “What’s in a name?” Names are important for our identity. There are names we are given at birth, names we use to connect or remember others, and names we use to label ourselves. In this series, we are going to look at some of the labels we wear, but we will also celebrate how Jesus can change those labels and give us a new name! Join us as we celebrate our connection to each other and say, “Hello, my name is ...”\n\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist",

He writes, “There hangs over each of us the awareness of moving toward something, of becoming something far finer than we have ever been. Ah, we may wince, but we are never for long free of that yearning to become better, that instinctive squirming to be let loose from some imprisoning and crippling web in which we are caught.

Don't miss this opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of how we can be rich toward God and live a life of generosity.",

      "description": "Join us as we explore the powerful message of being the church and embracing our mission as followers of Jesus. In this inspiring talk, we learn how God can transform our lives and use us to bring hope, healing, and freedom to others. Through stories from the Bible and real-life examples, we discover that we are called to be the Tabernacle of God, carrying His presence wherever we go. From the Old Testament to the New Testament, we see a trail of God's love and power, culminating in Jesus, who showed us how to proclaim the Kingdom of God and bring light to a world in need.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n1) God can turn our struggles and challenges into opportunities for growth and sharing with others.\n2) The Tabernacle in the Bible represents the dwelling place of God, and now, as followers of Jesus, we become His Tabernacle.\n3) Jesus fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah, bringing the law of God into our hearts and empowering us to live in freedom.\n4) We are called to carry the power of God and the message of the Kingdom, bringing healing and freedom to those in need.\n5) Embracing our mission as followers of Jesus means taking risks, stepping out of our comfort zones, and being bold in sharing His love and truth.\n6) The Kingdom of God is unshakable, and as followers of Jesus, we have the privilege to participate in advancing His Kingdom on Earth.\n\nCome and discover how you can be part of this radical mission of love and transformation. Get ready to experience the power of God's presence and embark on a life-changing adventure as a follower of Jesus.\n\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/harvest \nChurch Online: https://harvesttwumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/HarvestTWMC \nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/HarvestTWMC\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #radical #breakthrough #radicalmission",

Using examples from the Bible, Luann explains the cost of discipleship and how it calls for denying oneself, taking up the cross, and following Jesus daily. Luann shares personal experiences and encourages listeners to reflect on their own lives and what may be holding them back from fully surrendering to God.

      "description": "In this sermon, Luann Riley shares about what it means to be a disciple of Jesus and the radical commitment it requires. Using examples from the Bible, Luann explains the cost of discipleship and how it calls for denying oneself, taking up the cross, and following Jesus daily. Luann shares personal experiences and encourages listeners to reflect on their own lives and what may be holding them back from fully surrendering to God. Through radical commitment we can experience a life of faith and purpose.\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/harvest \nChurch Online: https://harvesttwumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/HarvestTWMC \nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/HarvestTWMC\n\n#radicalcommitment #discipleship #onlinechurch #harvesttwmc #surrender #surrendertogod",

Join us as we move forward in faith and respond to Jesus’ invitation to “follow me.”\n\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/harvest \nChurch Online: https://harvesttwumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/HarvestTWMC \nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/HarvestTWMC\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #grow #growtogether #invitation #followme",

      "description": "Harvest Worship | Mark Sorensen\n\nWe all love a “How To” book or podcast because we long to be stronger, smarter or better, but how do we learn to be more like Jesus? The 40 days of Lent is a journey towards the Resurrection of Easter day and towards learning how to follow Jesus. This Lent we will immerse ourselves in the ways Jesus lived through spiritual practices that will create a framework for our own formation. If you’ve ever wanted to learn “how to” be like Jesus, we invite you to join us in learning the ways of Jesus.\n\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/harvest \nChurch Online: https://harvesttwumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/HarvestTWMC \nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/HarvestTWMC\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #grow #growtogether #waysofjesus #lent #lentenseason",

Karen Tyler, our missions pastor, shares personal stories and insights about how her father's influence and a four-year-old's question ignited a fire in her heart for missions. We learn how we, as a church and as individuals, can respond to God's call to make a difference. It's a message that will inspire you to take action.\n\nDon't forget to subscribe to our channel for more uplifting content, and if you enjoy this video, give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends and family.

      "description": "Harvest Worship | Featuring Susan Kent\n\nMore than the perfect present or Christmas decoration, there is really only one gift we need each year and that is HOPE. As we celebrate this season of Advent, it is the Hope Revealed through the gift of Jesus which reminds us we have a God who hears our prayers, fulfills His promises and surrounds us with His presence. Hope is the light which guides us and lifts us up no matter our circumstances. This Christmas, come and receive the gift of hope that Jesus offers to our weary world.\n\nWeb:  https://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/harvest \nChurch Online: https://harvesttwumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/HarvestTWUMC \nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/HarvestTWUMC\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #hopeliveshere",

Today we celebrate and magnify God for His love for us all and the wonder found within the manger as Jesus entered into our world in the simplest of ways.

      "description": "Harvest Worship | Featuring Mark Sorensen\n\nEver heard of the phrase, “forged in fire”? The process is defined as the “making or shaping of a metal object through the process of heating it in a fire or furnace and beating or hammering it.” In this series, we’re looking at the story of Daniel in the Old Testament. Set in a time of Babylonian captivity, this story is one of remembering that, in uncertain times, God’s hands are not absent on the circumstances of our lives. We learn that even in the midst of the forging, there’s beauty and strength to be found in the art of formation.\n\nWeb:  https://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/harvest \nFacebook:  https://fb.com/HarvestTWUMC \nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/HarvestTWUMC",

      "description": "Join us as we embark on a journey through the book of Romans, exploring each chapter and uncovering what Paul had to say to the early church that is still relevant to us today. In this first chapter, we discuss the importance of community and being a part of the church, and how it can strengthen us as a collective force. We also set some ground rules for our study and ask for patience as we navigate this thick, theologically dense book that has informed much of Christendom. Let's dive into the first chapter of Romans together and discover what it means for us today.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n- Being part of a Christian community is important for our faith\n- The book of Romans is a complex but important book that has shaped Christian theology\n- We should be patient with ourselves and each other as we explore this book together\n- We should form our own theology based on the word of God, rather than simply accepting what someone else tells us to believe. \n\n\n\nWeb: https://www.twmc.org/woodforest\nChurch Online: https://woodforest.online.church/\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #bookofromans #romans1",

Whether you are a member of our church, an invited guest or a curious visitor, my prayer is you will find an unexplainable joy welling up in your spirit as you realize God has also arrived to meet with you here. We love having children with us in worship. We invite them forward at offering time, and then, before the sermon, they are invited to join Children’s Church. If your child (5th grade and younger) would like to attend Children’s Church, get them checked in before service. Please be sure to stop by our First Timer table or come and say hi to me on your way out.

      "description": "Woodforest Worship | Thomas Lake\n\nGood morning, neighbor! I’m glad you are here to worship God with our church family, and I trust they have already made you feel welcome. Whether you are a member of our church, an invited guest or a curious visitor, my prayer is you will find an unexplainable joy welling up in your spirit as you realize God has also arrived to meet with you here. We love having children with us in worship. We invite them forward at offering time, and then, before the sermon, they are invited to join Children’s Church. If your child (5th grade and younger) would like to attend Children’s Church, get them checked in before service. Please be sure to stop by our First Timer table or come and say hi to me on your way out. God bless you and thanks for coming!\n\n\nWeb: https://www.twmc.org/woodforest\nChurch Online: https://woodforest.online.church/\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #grow #growtogether",

Whether you are a member of our church, an invited guest or a curious visitor, my prayer is you will find an unexplainable joy welling up in your spirit as you realize God has also arrived to meet with you here. We love having children with us in worship. We invite them forward at offering time, and then, before the sermon, they are invited to join Children’s Church. If your child (5th grade and younger) would like to attend Children’s Church, get them checked in before service. Please be sure to stop by our First Timer table or come and say hi to me on your way out. God bless you and thanks for coming!\n\nWeb: https://www.twmc.org/woodforest\nChurch Online: https://woodforest.online.church/\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #grow #growtogether",

      "description": "Woodforest Worship | Daniel Lumpee\n\nMore. We want more! But what is it that we really want more of? At this time of year, with advertisements and commercials aplenty, we could easily be lured into wanting more of the stuff that we already have — newer or bigger and better versions. Yet, most of us have lived long enough to recognize that this never has, and never will, satisfy the deepest longings of our hearts. What we really are looking\nfor, far more than anything else, is more joy, hope, love and peace in our lives. Between now and Christmas, our church family will be digging into God’s word to see how the coming of Jesus can bring with it these things that we so deeply need.\n\nWeb: https://www.twmc.org/woodforest\nChurch Online: https://woodforest.online.church/\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #ignite #ourhopeforthefuture #searchingforchristmas #christmas #advent",

      "description": "Woodforest Worship | Featuring Brent Parker\n\nIn Tish Warren’s Liturgy of the Ordinary, we find the invitation to “become aware of God’s presence in surprising ways” as we walk through the ordinary parts of our daily lives. Throughout this series, we will figuratively walk through the everyday stuff of waking up and making our beds, of checking emails and gathering around our dinner tables at the end of a day, and then looking for the opportunities to find God “hiding” within the ordinariness of it all. Our hope is that each of us will find a new rhythm that seeks to make our ordinary life more extra-ordinary. Let’s start this morning.\n\nWeb: https://www.twmc.org/woodforest\nChurch Online: https://woodforest.online.church/\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #ignite #ourhopeforthefuture",

Through the story of Solomon, who chose wisdom over wealth, we learn that real wisdom comes from understanding God’s love. \n\nJoin us as we unpack how love and wisdom go hand-in-hand, shaping our lives and guiding our decisions. By embracing God’s love, we find peace, purpose, and the ultimate reward — a life that reflects Jesus. \n\nLet’s grow together in love and wisdom as we live out God’s calling.",

      "description": "As we wrap up our series, we explore Jesus' third appearance to His disciples after His resurrection. This encounter by the sea is a pivotal moment, reminding us of the significance of seeking God, no matter the time or place. Through the lens of John 21, we delve into how Jesus' simple breakfast with His disciples was more than a meal – it was a moment of restoration, reaffirmation, and a call to continue the mission He set forth.\n\nOur sermon reflects on how we, like the disciples, may find ourselves drifting away from our spiritual commitments but are always called back by Jesus. The breakfast by the sea symbolizes a new beginning, a restoration of faith, and a reminder that Jesus never forsakes us.",

As we navigate through these challenging times, remember that Jesus is our eternal lifeguard, ready to save us when we call out to him.\n\nJoin us as we explore the significance of having a lifeguard for our faith, the importance of reaching out to Jesus in our weakest moments, and the comfort of knowing that he is always there to rescue us from the depths of despair.

Since then, our world has not been the same. Prophets, angels, shepherds and wise men heralded the good news,\nand their message declared the greatest wonder of all: “Emmanuel — God is with us!” It is a story that never grows old, and we are delighted you are here to experience Advent and Christmas once again and to celebrate The Wonder of It All.",

      "description": "Our current sermon series, “When God Says No,” continues this week as we are taken to the Garden of Gethsemane to hear Jesus’ words of agony: “Take this cup from me.” \n\nWhat is the cup that Jesus refers to, and why would He make such a request of His Heavenly Father? But what is even more puzzling is why would God not grant permission in the final hours of His only Son’s life? These are the questions that we will address in this message - the answers might surprise you! Join us as we reflect on the significance of Jesus' sacrifice and learn to understand what it means when God says no to our requests.",

Last week, we talked about righteous judgment. This week, we'll delve deeper into faith, a crucial aspect of our spiritual journey.\n\nBut here's a little story for you! While Bishop Hayes was preparing this sermon, he stumbled upon a hidden treasure - a clay coaster with a profound quote: \"Faith is to believe what you do not yet see; the reward for faith is to see what you believe.\" 🙌✨ Talk about a God moment!\n\nSo, what does faith mean to you? How large is your faith? 🤔 Today, we'll explore these questions and dive into the incredible faith journey of Abraham, as explained by the Apostle Paul in Romans.\n\nAs we go through this message, remember that faith isn't just about believing in Jesus; it's about trusting in His promises, even in the face of adversity. When we embrace suffering and affirm the resurrection, our faith expands, making us more like Christ.\n\nSo, join us as we explore faith, hope, and God's incredible love in today's sermon.

      "description": "Forgiveness and respect are something often talked about in the Bible. In this message, Bishop Hayes shares about a lesser-known book in the Bible called Philemon. The book is a letter written by the Apostle Paul to Philemon, a fellow Christian, about forgiveness and the relationship between a master and a slave. However, the story of Philemon is important because it reveals the nature of God, forgiveness, and the inherent dignity and respect for all humanity. Philemon is a model citizen who shows that forgiveness can only be found when one follows Christ. The book is also a reminder that we should treat everyone with respect and dignity. Overall, the book of Philemon teaches us important lessons about forgiveness, respect, and treating others as equals.\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #modelcitizen #philemon #brotherinchrist",

      "description": "Traditional Worship | Bishop Bob Hayes  \n\nWhen we use the term “model citizen,” we most often think of a person living an exemplary life, possessing such qualities as honesty, integrity and truth. Individuals who demonstrate these characteristics usually stand out in a crowd and are easily recognized. However, the New Testament is full of model citizens who walked in Jesus’ footsteps but were not always given the notoriety many other disciples received. Not only were they strong in their faith, but their influence and contribution to the early church was significant. This sermon series reveals a few lesser-known followers of our Lord who serve as an inspiration to us, reminding us that we all have unique gifts to offer as we walk in the footsteps of Christ.\n\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #modelcitizen #josephofarimathea #secretdisciple",

Today, over 2,000 years later, our response and affirmation can be nothing less than “He is risen indeed!”\n\nWelcome to Easter Sunday — the most important day of our Christian faith. We are delighted that you have joined us to celebrate our Lord’s victory over sin and death. May you feel God’s presence as you encounter the risen Savior through the music, prayers, Scriptures and spoken word. \n\nEverything we do is rooted in the Good News of Jesus Christ.

It is a 40-day journey that invites us to enter into a deeper relationship with God as we remember the sacrifice Jesus made on our behalf which led Him to the cross on a hill called Calvary. Lent is a solemn and holy season, and travel along this road demands something of us, for it is only through prayer, confession, self-examination and sacrifice that we can arrive at that destination where we fully understand the hidden possibilities that lie dormant within each of us.

      "description": "Traditional Worship | Bishop Bob Hayes  \n\nWe now find ourselves in the season of Advent, a four-week period of preparation that culminates in the birth of Jesus. It should be a time of excitement and joy, of laughter and merriment. But for many, this season is a time of sadness, emptiness and frustration. Life should be wonderful, but how can it be when so many things take us away from the real joy of Christmas? How do we find light in the darkness, peace amid chaos and good news in a bad-news world? In this sermon series, “It’s (Not Always) a Wonderful Life,” we will rediscover the hope that comes from the faithful promises of God to bring peace through our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #grow #growtogether #itsnotalwaysawonderfullife",

      "description": "Traditional Worship | Bishop Bob Hayes  \n\nIn biblical times a seal and an insignia were often used to identify and protect anything confidential or of value. The seal specified to whom it belonged, preventing anyone else from tampering with its contents. In the book of Ephesians, the Apostle Paul compares the Holy Spirit to a seal, saying: “Having believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession.” Once a soul has trusted in Christ, that soul is sealed and made secure in Him. In this sermon series, we will focus on the promises made on our behalf, given to us through the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, all of which have been Signed, Sealed and Delivered!\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #grow #growtogether #sufferingisnotforever",

The seal specified to whom it belonged, preventing anyone else from tampering with its contents. In the book of Ephesians, the Apostle Paul compares the Holy Spirit to a seal, saying: “Having believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession.” Once a soul has trusted in Christ, that soul is sealed and made secure in Him.

      "description": "Traditional Worship | Bishop Bob Hayes  \n\nThe greatest invitation we will ever receive is to “follow” Jesus. Just as He called His first disciples to leave their nets and go with Him today, Jesus’ call is the same. He summons us to leave behind and let go of our busy and chaotic lives. He teaches us, empowers us, and offers us an opportunity to receive His salvation and go where He leads. Christ was always moving forward, and so must we. “Follow me” is still the call to abundant life, and it is our prayer we will accept His invitation to live out our faith and learn to extend the gifts He gives to others.\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #grow #growtogether #invitation #followme",

      "description": "Traditional Worship | Bishop Bob Hayes\n\nOn this July fourth, Americans from “sea to shining sea” will mark the signing of the Declaration of Independence that happened 246 years ago. Our services will reflect the patriotism that accompanies this event by singing national hymns and honoring those who served to maintain our political freedoms and religious liberties. It is also a time for\nus to remember that the scriptures say a lot about the freedom and liberty God provides. In Psalm 33:12, it says: “Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, the people He chose for His inheritance.” Let us remind ourselves that we have been a blessed people because God has always come first, and our independence is a direct result of our dependence upon God and the gift of Jesus Christ.\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #grow #growtogether #faithwesing #july4th",

      "description": "Traditional Worship | Bishop Bob Hayes\n\nSo many of the convictions we hold and the truths we believe are captured in the songs we sing! The reality is, we are singing people, and music, as seen throughout the Bible, trains us in the practice of remembering who God is and what God has done for us. In the book of Psalms, we are encouraged to “Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all his wonderful acts” (105:2). Through the gift of music, God has united art with truth and a way for the gospel message to sink itself into our hearts through singing and sharing our faith in song.\n\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #grow #growtogether #faithwesing",

Our series, Doors to Open, is an opportunity for us to enter into the new life that awaits us, for “if anyone is in Christ, they are a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!” (2 Corinthians 5:17)\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #grow #growtogether #lentendoors #lent #doorstoopen",

      "description": "Traditional Worship | Bishop Bob Hayes\n\nOur Christmas Eve worship services are some of the most cherished and beautiful gatherings in the life of our church. These services signal that we have reached our limits with the busyness of the season—the gift buying is over, our families are together, and we can finally focus on celebrating the birth of our Savior, Jesus Christ! This Christmas Eve, we go in search of the light that illumines our world and our lives, and our presence here tonight proclaims that no matter how dismal things may be, the light of Christ shines in the midst of our darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #ignite #ourhopeforthefuture #searchingforchristmas #christmas",

      "description": "The first Sunday in November is observed throughout the Christian world as All Saint’s Sunday, a time when we remember those who have died in the faith and who are now in union with God as members of the “Church triumphant.” We set aside this sacred day to honor the memory of those we have loved and lost. The gift of the Church belongs to us because of the “great cloud of witnesses” who surround us and who speak to us in our memories. Today we celebrate their witness and give praise and thanksgiving to God for allowing them to grace our lives.\n\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #ignite #ourhopeforthefuture #thewoodlandsmethodistchurch #twmc #home #allsaintssunday",

      "description": "Traditional Worship | Featuring Bishop Bob Hayes\n\nThe resurrection of Jesus on that first Easter morning goes to the heart of everything Christians hold dear and sacred. The empty tomb is the bedrock and foundation of our faith. As the Apostle Paul writes, “And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith.” (1 Corinthians 15:14) However, if we view Easter as the conclusion of Jesus’ ministry, we run the risk of missing out on some of the most important appearances that He makes following His resurrection. His words and actions during those days represent another side of the resurrection story that even most well-intentioned Christians miss. Bishop Hayes covers the “Rest of the Story,” as he shares why those days still hold importance and significance for us.\n\nWeb:  https://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsUMC \nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsUMC",

Once we experience this spark of light, we are inspired to share it with others and to create something bold and new.

It has pushed us to our limits in every aspect of our lives—spiritually, emotionally, physically and mentally. It has been a year of bad news on top of bad news. However, the God we serve has been at work on our behalf, and in this Christmas season brings us the Good News that “unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given!” It’s the very best news\nwe need to hear, for it represents the light we need that shines in the darkness of these difficult times.

The season of Advent is that moment! It is our confirmation that God has heard our prayers and is giving us His only begotten Son, our Savior, who is Christ the Lord! Our hope has not been in vain. In these four weeks leading up to Christmas, our sermon series – Hope Revealed – will examine God’s promise, presence and purpose, culminating in the person of Jesus Christ!\n\n\nWeb:  https://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsUMC \nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsUMC",

      "description": "Traditional Worship | Featuring Bishop Bob Hayes \n\nThroughout this very difficult year, the one word that has sustained us has been the word “hope.” It is the most precious of all human emotions, allowing our faith to believe that at any moment the God we serve will make Himself known, fulfilling our expectations. The season of Advent is that moment! It is our confirmation that God has heard our prayers and is giving us His only begotten Son, our Savior, who is Christ the Lord! Our hope has not been in vain. In these four weeks leading up to Christmas, our sermon series – Hope Revealed – will examine God’s promise, presence and purpose, culminating in the person of Jesus Christ!",

      "description": "Traditional Worship\n\nFeaturing Bishop Bob Hayes\n\nMirrors play an important role in our lives because they reflect how we see ourselves and how we are seen by those around us. But there is another mirror which radiates a reflection that only you and God can see, and it is the mirror of your heart! The Scriptures tell us that God doesn’t look at our outward appearance, but rather on our hearts (1Samuel 17:7), which means God has exclusive access to that inner-self, the real us that we protect and keep hidden. If this upcoming season of Lent is going to make a difference in our lives, then we must allow God to search us and know our hearts, and guide us in the path that leads to life.\n\nCatch up on any sermons you may have missed:\nWeb: http://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/ \nFacebook: http://fb.com/TheWoodlandsUMC \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsUMC",

This year, so many of us have walked “through the valley of the shadow of death,” or we have known someone who has been personally affected by the loss of a loved one. Bishop Bob Hayes has a special message for this sacred day of remembrance and celebration of life beyond death.",

As we enter this new year, we hope you will join us with a renewed commitment to invest in our children, church and community. It’s no secret that we live in a world that is hurting and lonely.  Many people within the church, and outside our walls, need to believe they were created by a God who loves them. As a church family we have a message of hope for the world and, by caring for others and providing a place to belong, we can live out that calling.  In this stewardship series we will celebrate what God has done, what God is doing, and what God will do through the spirit-filled lives of His church.\n\n\nCatch up on any sermons you may have missed:\nWeb: http://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/ \nFacebook: http://fb.com/TheWoodlandsUMC \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsUMC",

      "description": "Traditional Worship | Christmas 2019\n\nFeaturing Bishop Bob Hayes\n\nA recent Pew Research Survey reveals that most Americans believe our society is increasingly abandoning the religious aspects of Christmas. This leads me to believe that even though we celebrate Christmas, we have forgotten to invite the “honored guest” to His own party. Christmas for most of us is simply an event, and not a way of life. This Christmas Eve re-discover how the “Spirit of Christmas” can bring us joy and happiness throughout the year. Who knows? Maybe this year we can make it happen!\n\n\nCatch up on any sermons you may have missed:\nWeb: http://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/\nFacebook: http://fb.com/TheWoodlandsUMC\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsUMC",

He possessed a superb ability to paint pictures with His words; weaving the truths of the Kingdom of God into stories that captured imaginations ... then and now. But many of these parables offer as much mystery as they do insight, especially in our modern-day world. In this sermon series we will probe the deeper meanings of Jesus’ parables as we seek to understand their significance for our own lives.

Up and down the dusty plains of Judea He went, changing lives and performing miracles. Some might even suggest that Christ gave us a religion for the road. On this last Sunday of 2018, what words or advice would He give us as we prepare to travel down the unknown road of 2019?\n\nWeb: http://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/\nFacebook: http://fb.com/TheWoodlandsUMC\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsUMC",

For some, the road of gratitude and preparation that leads from Thanksgiving to Christmas can be a “spring of hope.” But for others, it can be a “winter of despair,” fueled by the stresses and strains of the most chaotic days of our lives. Believe it or not, God has a Word for us as we seek to find meaning and purpose in a season where we have everything, and yet, we have nothing.\n\n\nWeb: http://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/\nFacebook: http://fb.com/TheWoodlandsUMC\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsUMC",

      "description": "The Roman procurator known as Pontius Pilate will forever be remembered as the man who ordered the crucifixion of Christ. Though a man of unspeakable cruelty and violence, when he is presented with Jesus at his trial, Pilate realizes this man has done no wrong. He does everything he can to look the other way and evade any association with Jesus’ death, going to the extreme of washing his hands and declaring himself blameless of the blood of Christ. However, one question he puts before the crowd has haunted us for over 2000 years: “What shall we do with Jesus?” What will be our response?\n\nSermon 4/9/17 with Bishop Bob Hayes\n\nTraditional Worship\n\nWeb: http://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/\nFacebook: http://fb.com/TheWoodlandsUMC\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsUMC\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/TheWoodlandsUMC",

      "description": "Fear is a two-sided coin: one side can render us helpless and timid, while the other side can be a great motivator, inspiring us to uncommon boldness. The sermon for today focuses on Joseph of Arimathea, a distant follower of Jesus who lived on the fringes and in the shadows of discipleship because he was fearful of The Way. His story reminds us that we are “more than conquerors” of our fears when we accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior.\n\nSermon 4/2/17 with Bishop Bob Hayes\n\nTraditional Worship\n\nWeb: http://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/\nFacebook: http://fb.com/TheWoodlandsUMC\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsUMC\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/TheWoodlandsUMC",

      "description": "From the beginning of Jesus’ ministry to the very end, He was challenged, criticized, and tested by a variety of foes representing both the political and religious establishment of His time. They perceived Him to be a threat to the status quo, and everything He did or said was questioned and pronounced unlawful, especially by the Pharisees and Scribes. However, Jesus not only de ed their opposition, but He ushered in a new order where the greatest would be the least, and the exalted would be humbled. Today’s sermon asks the question “What can we learn from Jesus as we confront our modern-day challenges?”\n\nSermon 3/12/17 with Bishop Bob Hayes\n\nTraditional Worship\n\nWeb: http://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/\nFacebook: http://fb.com/TheWoodlandsUMC\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsUMC\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/TheWoodlandsUMC",

      "description": "This coming Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of Lent, the traditional 40-day period of fasting, prayer, penitence and self-examination practiced by Christians throughout the world. It is truly one of the “holiest” seasons of the liturgical year; but like so many other seasons, it often comes and goes without changing us inwardly. In order for us to make this Lenten season di erent from all the others, we will view Lent this year through the lens of the cross, acknowledging the fact that Christ did something for us that we cannot fathom, let alone repay! Today’s message invites us to draw near to God, knowing that if we sincerely try, God will draw near to us.\n\nSermon 2/26/17 with Bishop Bob Hayes\n\nTraditional Worship\n\nWeb: http://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/\nFacebook: http://fb.com/TheWoodlandsUMC\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsUMC\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/TheWoodlandsUMC",

      "description": "Throughout the Gospels Jesus is constantly reminding His followers that there is a “cost” involved with discipleship. So often we get so focused on the sacrifices we have to make and often lose sight of what we will receive in return for putting Jesus first and foremost in our lives. In fact, being a disciple of Jesus gives us certain privileges that far exceed anything we could gain or profit from in today’s world. Our message today seeks to remind us that if we are earnestly looking for life, we must be willing to lose it for the sake of Christ.\n\nSermon 2/19/17 with Bishop Bob Hayes\n\nTraditional Worship\n\nWeb: http://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/\nFacebook: http://fb.com/TheWoodlandsUMC\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsUMC\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/TheWoodlandsUMC",

In 2 Peter we are told to “grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,” because it is in learning about Him that we develop and mature. If where we are is not where we want to be, we can each grow by sharing our stories, joining a study or changing the habits of our prayer life. We invite you to join us for this new series as we grow together in our prayers, presence, gifts, service and witness.\n\nSermon 1/15/17 with Bishop Bob Hayes\n\nTraditional Worship\n\nWeb: http://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/\nFacebook: http://fb.com/TheWoodlandsUMC\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsUMC\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/TheWoodlandsUMC",

As we enter a new year and look to a brighter tomorrow, we need that light to shine bright. We know it is the light of Christ, the power of the Holy Spirit that ignites within us, equipping us to reflect our faith and God’s grace. Once we experience this spark of light, we are inspired to share it with others and to create something bold and new. In our stewardship series, we’ll learn how God’s light ignites our passion for ministry, our spirit of generosity and our reach to the world so we can have hope for the future.\n\nWeb: https://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/woodforest\nChurch Online: https://woodforest.online.church/",

Whether it is worship, on a retreat, or as a family prayer before bedtime, the words Jesus taught His earliest followers to pray have been uttered countless times by countless persons. The “Our Father,” as some have called it, was likely one of the first prayers you ever heard, and possibly the first scripture you were taught to memorize. But, why do we pray it? Why did Jesus teach it to His disciples? What do we mean when we pray it anyway? Glad you asked! And, glad you’re here to unpack it with us each week through Easter.",

In Mark chapter 8 the disciples were worried they hadn’t brought enough bread to eat, but they had literally just helped Jesus feed four thousand people with seven loaves of bread and a few small fish. Sometimes the best way to fight against worry and fear is to remember the specific ways God has worked in our own lives and throughout history. We hope this song brings you peace in knowing the love of our Heavenly Father.\n\n\nMichael Rafferty - acoustic guitar and vocals\nMandy Henson - vocals\nLeandro Reis - keys and vocals\nCraig Weaver - drums\nChris Houghton - bass\nEli Perez - electric guitar",

Moses was just going about his everyday life when he witnessed something extraordinary. God showed up in an unexpected way, and Moses listened. \n\nJust like with Moses, God invites us to seek Him and be ready for those “holy distractions” in our lives. When we seek God with all our hearts, we will find Him. \n\nJoin us as we dive into the importance of seeking God, recognizing His presence, and sharing His story with others.",

      "description": "As we continue our series on Acts, we're looking at Paul's unwavering commitment to spreading the Gospel, even when faced with imprisonment and persecution. His resolve to appeal to Caesar rather than taking the easier route back to Jerusalem is a testament to his faith and dedication.\n\nWe'll also reflect on the challenges of sharing our faith, drawing inspiration from the parable of the sower in Mark 4. This parable reminds us that while not every seed we plant will grow, our efforts are never in vain. Whether the seed falls on rocky ground, among thorns, or fertile soil, our job is to continue planting and trusting God to bring the increase.\n\nSharing our faith can be difficult, and it's natural to feel discouraged when our efforts don't seem to bear fruit. However, we must remember that God can work through every situation. Just as the farmer in the parable doesn't give up, we too must keep sowing seeds of hope, love, and faith.\n\nThank you for being part of our church family. We look forward to seeing you next week as we continue to explore the incredible stories and lessons from the book of Acts.",

Despite being imprisoned for two years, Paul’s dedication to his divine calling to go to Rome never wavered. Through Paul’s story, we learn about choosing desperate faith over comfort, and how such faith can transform lives and entire empires.\n\nThomas also draws a powerful parallel with the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, highlighting how their desperate faith amidst trials led to miraculous deliverance and recognition of God’s power.\n\nJoin us as we reflect on the importance of maintaining a desperate faith, even in the face of challenges. Let's embrace the call to be unwavering in our commitment to God, knowing that through our desperation, true transformation can occur.",

      "title": "Because He Lives: I Can Face Uncertain Days | Brent Parker",
      "description": "Featuring Brent Parker\n\nDuring our journey from Ash Wednesday to Easter, Christians are invited to take intentional steps from death into life. We begin with a healthy awareness of our humanity, and its frailty, along with our sin and the consequences of our sinful behavior. Then we look forward to the wonderful celebration of the new life we are given through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus at Easter. Because Jesus lives, we, His followers, are made alive as well. We will spend our Sundays between now and Easter uncovering exactly what we receive because He lives.\n\nPast sermons available at thewoodlandsumc.org/messages/woodforest",

We have been isolated, lonely, nervous, anxious and troubled by much of what 2020 has brought our way. As a result of this pandemic and a tense political cycle, there is a greater sense of hopelessness in the air than we have felt in a long time. Yet, as people of faith, we know that our desperate search for hope leads us back to a little manger in Bethlehem where God’s peace, joy and love arrived. In the birth of Jesus, we find hope revealed!\n\nWeb: https://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/woodforest\nChurch Online: https://woodforest.online.church/\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #hopeliveshere",

      "description": "Woodforest Worship | Featuring Brent Parker with Dr. John Hull \n\nWith so many needs in this world, where does a person start if they want to help? Obviously, the first step is to feel drawn to serve others. If you’re drawn, or feel “called by God,” to enter into the pains and needs of others, the next best step is to identify the particular needs that seem to resonate most with your gifts or passions. And then, the fun begins as you uncover the opportunities all around you to use your gifts to meet the needs in your own “backyard.” This morning, Dr. John Hull joins me as we discuss those places where God has been welcoming our church into ministry, hoping that you might find your way into one of those or even into a ministry of your own. Glad you’re here!\n\nWeb: https://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/woodforest\nChurch Online: https://woodforest.online.church/\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #ignite #ourhopeforthefuture",

We ask things of God, say things to God, and bring the needs of others to God, all in the hopes that He will respond to us with help and with greater understanding of the mysteries of life.

      "description": "Woodforest Worship | Brent Parker\n\nPrayer is one of the most intimate acts of faith for those who believe. Not only are we talking to God, but we are hearing from Him too. What we say to God often expresses our deepest longings. We ask things of God, say things to God, and bring the needs of others to God, all in the hopes that He will respond to us with help and with greater understanding of the mysteries of life. In this series, we will take the common\nthemes of our prayers and unpack what the Scriptures reveal about how God has answered the prayers of His people.\n\nWeb: https://www.twmc.org/woodforest\nChurch Online: https://woodforest.online.church/\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #ignite #ourhopeforthefuture #healing #areyoulistening",

We are in the midst of a 3-week “deep dive” into Jesus’ words from John 14:6: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” I hope that you will find your time with us this morning to be a source of encouragement and that both your heart and mind are filled with the knowledge of God’s love for you. Please be sure to let us know you visited by stopping at the First Timer table on your way out.

      "description": "Woodforest Worship | Brent Parker\n\nGood morning, neighbor! I’m glad you are here to worship God with our church family, and I trust they have already made you feel welcome. Whether you are a member of our church, an invited guest or a curious visitor, my prayer is you will find an unexplainable joy welling up in your spirit as you realize God has also arrived to meet with you here.

      "description": "Woodforest Worship | Brent Parker  \n\nGood morning, neighbor! I’m glad you are here to worship God with our church family, and I trust they have already made you feel welcome. Whether you are a member of our church, an invited guest or a curious visitor, my prayer is you will find an unexplainable joy welling up in your spirit as you realize God has also arrived to meet with you here. We love having children with us in worship. We invite them forward at offering time, and then, before the sermon, they are invited to join Children’s Church. If your child (5th grade and younger) would like to attend Children’s Church, get them checked in before service. Please be sure to stop by our First Timer table or come and say hi to me on your way out. God bless you and thanks for coming!\n\nWeb: https://www.twmc.org/woodforest\nChurch Online: https://woodforest.online.church/\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #grow #growtogether #gospelofjohn #john2",

      "description": "Join us as we embark on a journey through the book of Romans, exploring each chapter and uncovering what Paul had to say to the early church that is still relevant to us today. In this first chapter, we discuss the importance of community and being a part of the church, and how it can strengthen us as a collective force. We also set some ground rules for our study and ask for patience as we navigate this thick, theologically dense book that has informed much of Christendom. Let's dive into the first chapter of Romans together and discover what it means for us today.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n- Being part of a Christian community is important for our faith\n- The book of Romans is a complex but important book that has shaped Christian theology\n- We should be patient with ourselves and each other as we explore this book together\n- We should form our own theology based on the word of God, rather than simply accepting what someone else tells us to believe. \n\n\n\nWeb: https://www.twmc.org/woodforest\nChurch Online: https://woodforest.online.church/\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #bookofromans #romans1",

      "title": "Loving One Another: Unity Over Disputable Matters | Romans 14",
      "description": "Hey there, friends! Welcome to our church gathering! Today, we're diving into Romans Chapter 14, where we learn about the importance of unity and love among believers. It's like this: we may have some playful differences, just like when we talk about colleges, but what really matters is how we treat and care for one another. In this message, we explore how we can focus on the main thing - loving one another - and let go of arguments over disputable matters. Let's come together, find unity, and be inspired by God's love! If you're new here, no worries! You can catch up on what we've been studying, or you can join us on this journey. Don't forget to hit that \"like\" button, subscribe to our channel, and share this message with others. Thank you for being a part of our church family! God bless you all!",

      "description": "In today's message, we explore the fascinating transformation of Saul, a persecutor of early Christians who became one of the most influential figures in the early church. Join us as we delve into the Book of Acts, a narration of the early church's journey, to understand the lessons it holds for us today. Just like Saul's story, this is our story too, and we can learn valuable insights from the early church's experiences.\n\nLast week, we had our Mission Sunday, emphasizing the importance of missions in our community and around the world. Learn how you can participate in various ways - from praying for missions to making pledges for the missions offering. Join us as we uncover the power of faith and transformation.\n\nIn this passage, we witness Saul's encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus, a life-altering moment that changed him from a persecutor to a believer. We also highlight the significance of advocacy and encouragement, exemplified by Barnabas, and how it can profoundly impact lives.\n\nAs we explore the message further, let's reflect on how we can be agents of positive change and encouragement in the lives of those around us. Join us on this spiritual journey through Acts, and may you be inspired to make a difference in your community.\n\nDon't forget to subscribe, like, and share this video to help us spread the message.",

We'll also reflect on the impact of seeking God's will in our lives and how prayer can help us find our way even in challenging times.\n\nSo, whether you're a long-time churchgoer or new to the faith, this message is for you.

      "description": "As we continue our series on Acts, we're looking at Paul's unwavering commitment to spreading the Gospel, even when faced with imprisonment and persecution. His resolve to appeal to Caesar rather than taking the easier route back to Jerusalem is a testament to his faith and dedication.\n\nWe'll also reflect on the challenges of sharing our faith, drawing inspiration from the parable of the sower in Mark 4. This parable reminds us that while not every seed we plant will grow, our efforts are never in vain. Whether the seed falls on rocky ground, among thorns, or fertile soil, our job is to continue planting and trusting God to bring the increase.\n\nSharing our faith can be difficult, and it's natural to feel discouraged when our efforts don't seem to bear fruit. However, we must remember that God can work through every situation. Just as the farmer in the parable doesn't give up, we too must keep sowing seeds of hope, love, and faith.\n\nThank you for being part of our church family. We look forward to seeing you next week as we continue to explore the incredible stories and lessons from the book of Acts.",

      "description": "In this message, we explore three important lessons from Moses’ encounter with the burning bush. Moses was just going about his everyday life when he witnessed something extraordinary. God showed up in an unexpected way, and Moses listened. \n\nJust like with Moses, God invites us to seek Him and be ready for those “holy distractions” in our lives. When we seek God with all our hearts, we will find Him. \n\nJoin us as we dive into the importance of seeking God, recognizing His presence, and sharing His story with others.",

      "description": "[Note: This message was originally recorded in The Harvest Worship Center on January 12, 2020 and then re-aired for other services on January 19, 2020]\n\nFeaturing Mark Sorensen\n\nWe are called to a life filled with purpose and fearless faith – a life that matters. As we enter this new year, we hope you will join us with a renewed commitment to invest in our children, church and community. It’s no secret that we live in a world that is hurting and lonely.  Many people within the church, and outside our walls, need to believe they were created by a God who loves them. As a church family we have a message of hope for the world and, by caring for others and providing a place to belong, we can live out that calling.  In this stewardship series we will celebrate what God has done, what God is doing, and what God will do through the spirit-filled lives of His church.\n\nWeb: http://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/loft\nFacebook: http://fb.com/LoftChurch\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/LoftChurch",

      "description": "Woodforest Worship | Featuring Brent Parker with Dr. John Hull \n\nWith so many needs in this world, where does a person start if they want to help? Obviously, the first step is to feel drawn to serve others. If you’re drawn, or feel “called by God,” to enter into the pains and needs of others, the next best step is to identify the particular needs that seem to resonate most with your gifts or passions. And then, the fun begins as you uncover the opportunities all around you to use your gifts to meet the needs in your own “backyard.” This morning, Dr. John Hull joins me as we discuss those places where God has been welcoming our church into ministry, hoping that you might find your way into one of those or even into a ministry of your own. Glad you’re here!\n\nWeb: https://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/woodforest\nChurch Online: https://woodforest.online.church/\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #ignite #ourhopeforthefuture",

      "description": "Woodforest Worship | Featuring Dr. Stew Grant\n\nNot everyone gets married or stays married. If you read marriage as a motif in scriptures, then it conveys something profound for all believers. Marriage is actually a very complex relationship. There are many dynamics that we simply cannot prepare for lifetime commitment. The truth is you were never meant to go it alone as a couple. God created marriage not just for fulfillment, but also for transformation. We should become better people when we are married. Sometimes, we choose to regress in our growth. There is hope and there is help through scripture, relational sciences and the church.\n\n\nWeb: https://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/woodforest\nChurch Online: https://woodforest.online.church/",

What we say to God often expresses our deepest longings. We ask things of God, say things to God, and bring the needs of others to God, all in the hopes that He will respond to us with help and with greater understanding of the mysteries of life. In this series, we will take the common\nthemes of our prayers and unpack what the Scriptures reveal about how God has answered the prayers of His people.\n\nWeb: https://www.twmc.org/woodforest\nChurch Online: https://woodforest.online.church/\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #ignite #ourhopeforthefuture #healing #areyoulistening",

We are in the midst of a three-week “deep dive” into Jesus’ words from John 14:6: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” I hope that you will find your time with us this morning to be a source of encouragement and that both your heart and mind are filled with the knowledge of God’s love for you. Please be sure to let us know you visited by stopping at the First Timer table on your way out.

      "description": "Is God's love for everyone? In this video, we're diving into Acts 11 to uncover an amazing story about how God's love and power can change lives. Thomas shares a fascinating story about how Peter, one of Jesus' closest friends, had a dream that changed everything. People back then thought the good news about Jesus was only for a certain group, but Peter's dream showed that God's love is for everyone. It's like a big invitation to a party, and no one is left out! You'll be encouraged to be like Peter, to share God's love with everyone and remember that God's love can empower us to do amazing things.",

      "description": "In today’s message, Thomas explores Acts 25, providing rich context from previous chapters (Acts 22-24) to illuminate Paul’s trials and steadfast faith. Despite being imprisoned for two years, Paul’s dedication to his divine calling to go to Rome never wavered. Through Paul’s story, we learn about choosing desperate faith over comfort, and how such faith can transform lives and entire empires.\n\nThomas also draws a powerful parallel with the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, highlighting how their desperate faith amidst trials led to miraculous deliverance and recognition of God’s power.\n\nJoin us as we reflect on the importance of maintaining a desperate faith, even in the face of challenges. Let's embrace the call to be unwavering in our commitment to God, knowing that through our desperation, true transformation can occur.",

      "description": "If we were to take even a quick inventory of our lives, we would quickly recognize that God has given us more than we could ever ask or imagine. If upon that quick glance, we find ourselves still wanting, it could be that we need to take a second look around the landscape of our lives to uncover those not-so-obvious bits of evidence that God is providing all that we need. As we notice the abundance of God’s provision in our lives, our next realization is to see that we have each been entrusted with these blessings not so much to hold onto them but to pass them around open-handedly. Throughout this series, we are going to return over and over to the question: “Am I a good steward of my life?” Your answer to this question will directly impact your experience of 2018.\n\nWeb: http://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/woodforest\nFacebook: http://fb.com/churchatwoodforest",

Because as Senior Pastor I have the opportunity to share the State of the Church address with you. We will celebrate what God has done in 2019 through our ministries and our members, and we will look forward to the calling God has placed on our lives. Today, I will share some statistics about our church, but I will also share stories that show the vitality and vision of this family of faith. I pray that today’s worship will remind you of God’s faithfulness and will give you a sense of hope for the future.",

As we enter a new year and look to a brighter tomorrow, we need that light to shine bright. We know it is the light of Christ, the power of the Holy Spirit that ignites within us, equipping us to reflect our faith and God’s grace. Once we experience this spark of light, we are inspired to share it with others and to create something bold and new. In our stewardship series, we’ll learn how God’s light ignites our passion for ministry, our spirit of generosity and our reach to the world so we can have hope for the future.\n\nWeb: https://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/woodforest\nChurch Online: https://woodforest.online.church/",

      "description": "Traditional Worship | Featuring Dr. Ed Robb\n\nToday I share with you my last sermon as Senior Pastor. What a blessing it has been to serve you and to lead this church. This will not be a sad day, but a day of celebration because we have so much to be thankful for. What an honor to celebrate all who have come to faith, the difference our church has made in the world, and the bright future ahead. But in all that we celebrate, my greatest joy has been the privilege to tell the story of Jesus Christ.\n\nWeb:  https://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsUMC \nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsUMC",

      "description": "Woodforest Worship | Dr. Edmund W. Robb III\n\nHave you ever poured out dominos, lined them up in formation and experienced the joy of watching them fall down by simply tipping the first one over? Maybe you accidentally tipped a domino over and watched your hard work topple prematurely. For the Sundays between Easter and Memorial Day weekend, we are going to unpack how God sent His Holy Spirit to accomplish a very different “domino effect” as we walk through the book of Colossians. We will see how the Holy Spirit works to exponentially grow God’s Kingdom, and we will recommit ourselves to being one of the “dominos” in the line.\n\n\nWeb: https://www.twmc.org/woodforest\nChurch Online: https://woodforest.online.church/\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #grow #growtogether #dominoeffect",

Whether you are a member of our church, an invited guest or a curious visitor, my prayer is you will find an unexplainable joy welling up in your spirit as you realize God has also arrived to meet with you here. We love having children with us in worship. We invite them forward at offering time, and then, before the sermon, they are invited to join Children’s Church. If your child (5th grade and younger) would like to attend Children’s Church, get them checked in before service. Please be sure to stop by our First Timer table or come and say hi to me on your way out.

      "description": "If we were to take even a quick inventory of our lives, we would quickly recognize that God has given us more than we could ever ask or imagine. If upon that quick glance, we find ourselves still wanting, it could be that we need to take a second look around the landscape of our lives to uncover those not-so-obvious bits of evidence that God is providing all that we need. As we notice the abundance of God’s provision in our lives, our next realization is to see that we have each been entrusted with these blessings not so much to hold onto them but to pass them around open-handedly. Throughout this series, we are going to return over and over to the question: “Am I a good steward of my life?” Your answer to this question will directly impact your experience of 2018.\n\nWeb: http://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/woodforest\nFacebook: http://fb.com/churchatwoodforest",

      "description": "Woodforest Worship | Brent Parker\n\nGood morning, neighbor! I’m glad you are here to worship God with our church family, and I trust they have already made you feel welcome. Whether you are a member of our church, an invited guest or a curious visitor, my prayer is you will find an unexplainable joy welling up in your spirit as you realize God has also arrived to meet with you here. We love having children with us in worship. We invite them forward at offering time, and then, before the sermon, they are invited to join Children’s Church. If your child (5th grade and younger) would like to attend Children’s Church, get them checked in before service. Please be sure to stop by our First Timer table or come and say hi to me on your way out. God bless you and thanks for coming!\n\n\nWeb: https://www.twmc.org/woodforest\nChurch Online: https://woodforest.online.church/\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #grow #growtogether",

      "description": "Woodforest Worship | Brent Parker\n\nEverything that has life grows. From trees to animals to children to you and me — we all grow. This year, 2022, is our time to grow together with a renewed focus and vision by choosing an intentional path. Jesus has invited us to follow Him on a life-long journey to grow in maturity, love our neighbors, share our faith, and, ultimately, become more like Him. I’m ready to have the abundant life Jesus offers in John 10:10, aren’t you? Let’s find it by growing together!\n\nWeb: https://www.twmc.org/woodforest\nChurch Online: https://woodforest.online.church/\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #grow #growtogether #walkwithgod",
