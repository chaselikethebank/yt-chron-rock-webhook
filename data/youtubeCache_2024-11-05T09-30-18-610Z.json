      "title": "Faith Over Fear: Trusting God Beyond Election Day",
      "description": "In this message, we’re reminded that while Election Day brings uncertainty, our faith in God gives us peace beyond politics. Pastor Daniel shares a story about explaining his vote to his young daughter, emphasizing that our confidence comes not from earthly leaders but from our eternal King. \n\nWhat should our mindset be the day after the election? We’re encouraged to focus on three key truths: God is not surprised, the sun will rise again, and Jesus is Lord, no matter who wins. \n\nBy keeping our eyes on God’s promises, we can face any future with faith. \n\nJoin us as we dive into Hebrews 11 and reflect on what it truly means to seek God’s Kingdom first!",

      "description": "In this message, we dive into Exodus 20, the chapter where God shares the Ten Commandments with Moses and the people of Israel. These commandments are much more than rules—they represent God’s deep desire for a relationship with His people. \n\nWe’ll look at how these commandments connect to Jesus' teachings on the greatest commandments: to love God with all your heart and to love your neighbor as yourself. Reflect with us on what it means to live out God’s love, not just in words, but in actions, even when it’s challenging. \n\nJoin us as we explore how to keep God at the center of our lives and truly embody His love.",
