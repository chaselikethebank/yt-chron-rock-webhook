      "description": "Finding the Right Balance: Faith and Politics\n\nIn this sermon, we explore the important relationship between our faith and politics. \n\nMany people struggle with how to connect their beliefs with their political views. We look at the story of Jesus and Pontius Pilate in John 18 to discover three different approaches to this relationship. One approach believes politics should guide faith, while another suggests keeping them completely separate. But what is the best way? \n\nJoin us as we find the answer in the teachings of Jesus and learn how our faith can inform our political actions for a better world!",
