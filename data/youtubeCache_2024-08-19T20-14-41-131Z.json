      "description": "This weekend, we're also kicking off an exciting new three-week sermon series called \"Speak Easy.\" Despite the name, it’s not about prohibition-era drinks! Instead, we're diving into the topic of evangelism – a word that sometimes carries a bit of baggage. Over the next three weeks, we’ll explore why evangelism is so important and how we can share our faith in a loving, relationship-focused way.\n\nToday, we'll start with the \"why\" of evangelism, followed by practical \"how-to\" steps in the coming weeks. Our goal is to empower and equip you to share the hope we have in Jesus Christ, especially as we approach the fall season and new routines begin.\n\nJoin us as we delve into the Great Commandment (Mark 12) and the Great Commission (Matthew 28) to understand our mission to love our neighbors and preach the gospel. Let’s embrace our role in spreading the good news and being good neighbors in our daily lives.\n\nThank you for being a part of our community. Let's go out and make a difference together!",

      "description": "Today’s message, \"Finding Faith and Resilience Amidst Life's Storms,\" touches on the unpredictability of life and the strength we find in faith.\n\n Despite the chaos brought by Hurricane Beryl, the message is clear: God's love remains steadfast, regardless of our circumstances. Whether you have power or are still in the dark, whether you’ve faced minor inconveniences or significant hardships, know that Jesus loves you.\n\nWe also explore the importance of avoiding bad theology in times of crisis. Our pastor warns against interpreting individual events as signs of divine favor or disfavor. Instead, we are reminded that we live in a broken world in need of redemption, and it’s through Jesus Christ that we find restoration and hope.\n\nLastly, the message calls us to examine our discipleship and the cost of following Jesus. True faith requires commitment, sacrifice, and a willingness to endure hardships. But the rewards of a life fully devoted to Christ are beyond measure.\n\nAs we navigate through these challenging times, let us be a church that supports and uplifts each other. If you need help, please reach out – you are not alone. We are here to serve and stand by you.",

Whether it's traffic woes, work pressures, or family challenges, these instances test our patience and resilience. In this message, we reflect on these moments and find wisdom in the story of Jesus reaching His own breaking point. We explore the powerful narrative of Jesus flipping the tables in the temple, an event recorded in all four Gospels. What made Jesus angry? How can we ensure our actions do not evoke such anger from Him?\n\nThrough the lens of Matthew 21, we examine the implications of Jesus' actions and uncover the deeper lessons about justice, compassion, and maintaining the purity of our spiritual temple. Join us as we navigate our emotions and align our lives more closely with the teachings of Christ.",

      "description": "In our spiritual journey, we often seek clarity, yet true understanding unfolds over time. The story of Jesus healing a blind man in two stages in Mark 8:22-26 illustrates the gradual process of spiritual enlightenment. Initially, the man sees people as trees walking, but with Jesus's second touch, his sight is fully restored. This teaches us that spiritual growth requires patience and that life's messiness can lead to a deeper faith. This message will guide you through the importance of patience, trust in God's timing, and the call to consecration in our spiritual growth. If you're seeking answers on how to navigate your faith journey, find inspiration here to move from uncertainty to a place of clear vision and purpose. Join us in reflecting on this transformative biblical narrative and its application to our lives today.",

      "description": "If you've ever felt inadequate in your prayer life or struggled to connect with God, you're not alone. Today, we're candidly sharing about our own challenges with prayer and dismantling common misconceptions surrounding it.\n\nThroughout the message, we tackle three prevalent lies about prayer. Firstly, the misconception that prayer is only for the super-righteous or holy individuals. Secondly, the belief that unanswered prayers indicate prayer's ineffectiveness. And finally, the notion that prayer must be elaborate or verbose to be powerful.\n\nDrawing from real-life examples, biblical teachings, and personal anecdotes, we uncover the power of simple prayers and the transformative impact they can have on our lives. Whether you're a seasoned prayer warrior or just beginning your journey of faith, this episode offers practical insights and encouragement to revitalize your prayer life.",

      "description": "In this sermon, Pastor Daniel Lumpee wraps up our four-week series called \"The Good Fight\" talking about finding true contentment. We've been learning from Paul's instructions to young Timothy about how to shine the light of Jesus in a dark world and fight the good fight of faith. 💪\n\nWe discovered that the weapons for this spiritual battle might not be what we expected. Instead of physical tools, Paul points to essential qualities like rejecting false teaching, the power of prayer, and living out the Gospel in our actions. Today, we focused on the weapon of \"Contentment.\" 🛡️\n\nBeing content means finding joy and peace in what we have, rather than constantly desiring more. It's about realizing that true happiness isn't in wealth or possessions but in Jesus Christ. \n\nWe also discussed how comparison can rob us of contentment and how having an eternal perspective helps us focus on what truly matters. And guess what? Being generous with our hearts and giving of ourselves also leads to contentment! \n\nSo, let's remember to fix our eyes on Jesus, surrender to Him, and trust that He will make what we have enough. With Jesus on our side, we can face any challenge and fight the good fight! \n\n🔔 Remember to subscribe and hit the notification bell to join our church community!\n🙌 Share this video with friends and family who love God's Word!",

He defines worship as \"the way in which we glorify God and enjoy him forever.\" He then goes on to say that worship is not about our actions, but about our hearts. He challenges us to find a reason to praise God every time we walk into church, even if it is something as simple as having breath in our lungs. encourage you to find a way to worship God today. It doesn't have to be anything fancy or elaborate. Just take some time to tell God how much you love him and thank him for all he has done for you. You will be glad you did!\n\n#worship #worshipmusic #praiseandworship #whatisworship",

She highlights that as Christians, we don't have to be perfect because we have a heavenly Father who fills the gaps with His love and grace. Karen encourages us to stay surrendered to Jesus, live a life of prayer, and embrace the gift of forgiveness. She explains the three steps to give the gift of forgiveness: forgiving the person who hurt us, praying for them, and blessing them. Through forgiveness, we can experience healing, freedom, and a changed heart. The message reminds us of Jesus' ultimate sacrifice and the power of forgiveness that comes from His love. Let us embrace forgiveness and walk in the freedom it brings.\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/loft\nChurch Online: https://loftchurch.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/LoftChurch\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/LoftChurch\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #forgiveness",

      "description": "Loft Worship | Daniel Lumpee\n\nWelcome to Loft, and Happy Easter! \n\nToday is a day we remember that death does not have the final say. We celebrate the historical fact that Jesus’ tomb was empty and that He is risen. And because Jesus is risen, when you receive Him into your life, the power of the resurrected Christ lives in you. Easter promises us that if Jesus is our Lord, we can experience abundant life on this side of the grave, and eternal life forevermore. We’re so grateful you are celebrating with us today, and we hope to see you again soon. He is risen!\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/loft\nChurch Online: https://loftchurch.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/LoftChurch\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/LoftChurch\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #easter #easter2023 #resurrection #heisrisen",

      "description": "What do we believe about relationships? Jesus said in John 14, “I am the way, the truth, and the life.” Jesus — our Messiah and our Savior — is also the source of all truth. We can turn to Him for all of life’s big questions. That’s what we’re doing in this series we’ve called “TinderBox.” We know that the world sends us all kinds of messages about relationships, and if we’re not careful, we can believe society’s lies. During this series, we’ll be looking at what God’s Word has to say about our relationships so that we can battle the world’s lies with God’s truth. Whether you're single or in a relationship, this video is a great way to look at relationships from a different perspective and get some helpful advice in the process!\n\nLoft Worship | Daniel Lumpee\n\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/loft\nChurch Online: https://loftchurch.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/LoftChurch\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/LoftChurch\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #tinderbox #thegrassisgreener #comparison",

      "description": "As we continue our series on Acts, we're looking at Paul's unwavering commitment to spreading the Gospel, even when faced with imprisonment and persecution. His resolve to appeal to Caesar rather than taking the easier route back to Jerusalem is a testament to his faith and dedication.\n\nWe'll also reflect on the challenges of sharing our faith, drawing inspiration from the parable of the sower in Mark 4. This parable reminds us that while not every seed we plant will grow, our efforts are never in vain. Whether the seed falls on rocky ground, among thorns, or fertile soil, our job is to continue planting and trusting God to bring the increase.\n\nSharing our faith can be difficult, and it's natural to feel discouraged when our efforts don't seem to bear fruit. However, we must remember that God can work through every situation. Just as the farmer in the parable doesn't give up, we too must keep sowing seeds of hope, love, and faith.\n\nThank you for being part of our church family. We look forward to seeing you next week as we continue to explore the incredible stories and lessons from the book of Acts.",

Despite the hardships Paul faced in prison, he remained committed to God’s call to go to Rome. Thomas encourages us to embrace desperation for God, like Paul and other biblical figures, to bring about true change in the world. \n\nJoin us in this journey of faith and discover how choosing God over comfort can transform our lives and our communities.",

As we dive into Acts 20-21, we'll recount the story of Eutychus and Paul's unwavering determination to reach Jerusalem, despite knowing the suffering that awaited him.

Discover how the Holy Spirit can transform your daily walk with God, confront your idols, and lead you to true spiritual freedom. Learn about the significant shift from John's baptism—a symbol of repentance—to the baptism of Jesus, which beckons the Holy Spirit to initiate profound internal change. Reflect on your own spiritual practices: Are they merely weekly rituals, or do they represent a daily, devoted walk with God? Witness the profound influence of the Holy Spirit in Ephesus, as seen in Acts 19, where Paul's ministry brought about healing and challenged idolatry, showcasing the Spirit's enduring power to transform lives.

      "description": "Is God's love for everyone? In this video, we're diving into Acts 11 to uncover an amazing story about how God's love and power can change lives. Thomas shares a fascinating story about how Peter, one of Jesus' closest friends, had a dream that changed everything. People back then thought the good news about Jesus was only for a certain group, but Peter's dream showed that God's love is for everyone. It's like a big invitation to a party, and no one is left out! You'll be encouraged to be like Peter, to share God's love with everyone and remember that God's love can empower us to do amazing things.",

Join us as we delve into the Book of Acts, a narration of the early church's journey, to understand the lessons it holds for us today. Just like Saul's story, this is our story too, and we can learn valuable insights from the early church's experiences.\n\nLast week, we had our Mission Sunday, emphasizing the importance of missions in our community and around the world. Learn how you can participate in various ways - from praying for missions to making pledges for the missions offering. Join us as we uncover the power of faith and transformation.\n\nIn this passage, we witness Saul's encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus, a life-altering moment that changed him from a persecutor to a believer. We also highlight the significance of advocacy and encouragement, exemplified by Barnabas, and how it can profoundly impact lives.\n\nAs we explore the message further, let's reflect on how we can be agents of positive change and encouragement in the lives of those around us. Join us on this spiritual journey through Acts, and may you be inspired to make a difference in your community.\n\nDon't forget to subscribe, like, and share this video to help us spread the message.

      "title": "Exploring Romans 4: Discovering God's Promises",
      "description": "Join us on a journey through the book of Romans, where we learn about the teachings of the Apostle Paul. In this chapter, Romans 4, we delve into the story of Abraham and explore the concept of righteousness through faith. We discover that Paul's writings in Romans are influenced by his encounter with Jesus, which transformed his life. By reading Romans with the lens of Jesus' grace and love, we gain a new understanding of God's promises and how they relate to our lives today.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n-Paul's letters, including Romans, were written after his encounter with Jesus, and they reflect his understanding of God's grace.\n-We have an advantage as believers because we know God's promises and have access to His Word.\n-Everyone, including Abraham, has sinned and fallen short of God's glory. However, through faith, we can be justified by God's grace.\n-Abraham's story teaches us the importance of having hope and unwavering faith in God's promises, even when circumstances seem impossible.\n-The promises made to Abraham and David in the Bible can give us confidence that God is faithful and will fulfill His promises in our lives too.\n-Taking steps of faith and believing in God's power can lead to righteousness and a deeper relationship with Him.\n\nJoin us as we explore the book of Romans, uncovering God's promises, and understanding how they can impact our lives today.\n\n\nWeb: https://www.twmc.org/woodforest\nChurch Online: https://woodforest.online.church/",

      "description": "Join us as we embark on a journey through the book of Romans, exploring each chapter and uncovering what Paul had to say to the early church that is still relevant to us today. In this first chapter, we discuss the importance of community and being a part of the church, and how it can strengthen us as a collective force. We also set some ground rules for our study and ask for patience as we navigate this thick, theologically dense book that has informed much of Christendom. Let's dive into the first chapter of Romans together and discover what it means for us today.\n\n\nWeb: https://www.twmc.org/woodforest\nChurch Online: https://woodforest.online.church/\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #bookofromans #romans1",

      "description": "As we wrap up our series, we explore Jesus' third appearance to His disciples after His resurrection. This encounter by the sea is a pivotal moment, reminding us of the significance of seeking God, no matter the time or place. Through the lens of John 21, we delve into how Jesus' simple breakfast with His disciples was more than a meal – it was a moment of restoration, reaffirmation, and a call to continue the mission He set forth.\n\nOur sermon reflects on how we, like the disciples, may find ourselves drifting away from our spiritual commitments but are always called back by Jesus. The breakfast by the sea symbolizes a new beginning, a restoration of faith, and a reminder that Jesus never forsakes us.",

      "title": "[Full Service] Finding God in the Quiet Places: Prayer",
      "description": "Traditional Worship | March 3, 2024 | Rev. Margarita McCarthy\n\nThe season of Lent has its roots in the 40 days Jesus spent fasting and being tempted in the wilderness. Just as Christ relied on the Word of God to sustain Him, we, too, must use this season to nourish our souls as we experience our own temptations. One way for us to prepare ourselves and be ready for the great festival of the resurrection of Christ, which Easter celebrates, is to find God in the quiet places along our own Lenten journey. The prophet Isaiah wrote, “Seek the Lord while he may be found; call upon him while he is near.” In this holy, 40-day season, our sermon series is designed to help us seek and find God in the tranquil and peaceful places where we, like Christ, can be victorious over all those things that separate us from God. We are delighted you have joined us for our Lenten journey.\n\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #thatsourchurch #ourchurch #findinggod #quietplaces #prayer",

But what is even more puzzling is why would God not grant permission in the final hours of His only Son’s life? These are the questions that we will address in this message - the answers might surprise you!

      "description": "Today, we continue our series, \"Survival of the Fittest,\" where we explore the Book of Romans, digging into faith, righteousness, and what it means to be spiritually fit. Last week, we talked about righteous judgment. This week, we'll delve deeper into faith, a crucial aspect of our spiritual journey.\n\nBut here's a little story for you! While Bishop Hayes was preparing this sermon, he stumbled upon a hidden treasure - a clay coaster with a profound quote: \"Faith is to believe what you do not yet see; the reward for faith is to see what you believe.\" 🙌✨ Talk about a God moment!\n\nSo, what does faith mean to you? How large is your faith? 🤔 Today, we'll explore these questions and dive into the incredible faith journey of Abraham, as explained by the Apostle Paul in Romans.\n\nAs we go through this message, remember that faith isn't just about believing in Jesus; it's about trusting in His promises, even in the face of adversity. When we embrace suffering and affirm the resurrection, our faith expands, making us more like Christ.\n\nSo, join us as we explore faith, hope, and God's incredible love in today's sermon. Don't forget to like, share, and subscribe to our channel for more inspiring content. \n\n🔔 Stay tuned for more uplifting messages and worship services!

      "description": "Traditional Worship | Bishop Bob Hayes  \n\nThere is a road that begins on Ash Wednesday and ends at Easter—it is called Lent. It is a 40-day journey that invites us to enter into a deeper relationship with God as we remember the sacrifice Jesus made on our behalf which led Him to the cross on a hill called Calvary. Lent is a solemn and holy season, and travel along this road demands something of us, for it is only through prayer, confession, self-examination and sacrifice that we can arrive at that destination where we fully understand the hidden possibilities that lie dormant within each of us. This road trip can become the most important journey we will ever take, for it summons us to die unto our sins so we may celebrate the Resurrection and the promise of eternal life with the One who died for us and gave Himself as a living sacrifice for all.\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/ \nChurch Online: https://twumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/TheWoodlandsMethodist\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #roadtrip #lent #lent2023 #rulesoftheroad",

      "description": "In this week's message, we reflect on the profound joy and necessity of taking our faith beyond the walls of the church. Moments of collective worship are powerful, but our calling extends into the community, especially during times of disaster and hardship.\n\nJoin us as we dive into:\n\nThe importance of worshiping in the marketplace, inspired by Paul's example.\n\nThe resilience and joy found in worshiping even in the midst of power outages and challenges.\n\nHow our attitudes and actions during difficult times can be a powerful testimony to those around us.\n\nThis message is a reminder that no matter the storms we face, we can find strength and peace in praising God. It’s a call to be the hands and feet of Jesus in our communities, spreading His love and hope.\n\n🙏 Prayer: \"Father, may we be bringers and breathers of peace in a chaotic world. Use us to share Your love and hope with those around us. Thank You for the opportunity to worship together and to take Your light into the world. Amen.\"\n\n📖 Scriptures Referenced:\n\nPsalm 46:10\nRomans 12:9\nJames 1:2-4\nMatthew 6:34",

Anticipation is not only a countdown to a day on the calendar, but also a journey of the heart. This holiday season, we invite you to pause, take a deep breath and rediscover The Wonder of It All.",

      "title": "Embracing the Radical Mission of God for a More Meaningful Life - Carolyn Moore",
      "description": "In this powerful message about the living life on mission with God, Carolyn Moore encourages us to challenge the status quo and calls us to live beyond the limitations and expectations of culture. When we live life on mission with God we are invited into a deeper, more meaningful existence, to a life of purpose and fulfillment that goes beyond the superficial and fleeting pleasures that culture offers. \n\nCulture, on the other hand, is often driven by the pursuit of self-gratification, instant gratification, and the accumulation of wealth and power. It is a message that often celebrates and reinforces the values of consumerism, individualism, and hedonism, promoting a lifestyle that is often marked by materialism, superficiality, and emptiness. \n\nThe mission of God, however, offers us an alternative to this way of living. It calls us to a life of service, sacrifice, and love, to a life of compassion and generosity towards others. It invites us to embrace a more holistic perspective on life, one that recognizes the interconnectedness of all things, and the sacredness of all life. \n\nIn a world that is increasingly consumed by the culture of self, the message of God offers us a way out of the trap of materialism and self-centeredness. It calls us to transcend our narrow interests and pursue a higher purpose, one that is rooted in the pursuit of justice, compassion, and love for all. \n\nIn short, the radical mission of God offers us a better way of living, one that is more meaningful, more fulfilling, and ultimately more satisfying than the message of culture. It is a mission that invites us to be agents of change in a world that desperately needs it, and to be a light in the darkness, bringing hope, healing, and love to all those around us. \n\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/harvest \nChurch Online: https://harvesttwumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/HarvestTWMC \nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/HarvestTWMC\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #radical #breakthrough #radicalmission",

Having radical faith through the Holy Spirit is a transformative experience that can turn your life upside down in the best possible way. It means abandoning yourself to the power and guidance of the Holy Spirit, and allowing yourself to be moved by the divine force of love that flows through all of creation. \n\nWith radical faith, you can move mountains and accomplish the impossible. You become fearless in the face of adversity, knowing that you are not alone but accompanied by the Holy Spirit who gives you strength and wisdom to overcome any obstacle. \n\nRadical faith through the Holy Spirit also means living a life of joy and purpose. It means finding your true calling and living it out with passion and conviction, knowing that you are doing the work of God and making a positive impact on the world. \n\nIt's not always an easy path, but having radical faith through the Holy Spirit is a journey worth taking. It will challenge you, transform you, and ultimately lead you to a deeper connection with God and a life filled with meaning and purpose. So if you're ready to step out in faith and experience the power of the Holy Spirit, get ready for a wild and wonderful ride! \n\n\nWeb:  https://www.twmc.org/harvest \nChurch Online: https://harvesttwumc.online.church/\nFacebook:  https://fb.com/HarvestTWMC \nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/HarvestTWMC\n\n\n#onlinechurch #livechurch #radical #radicalfaith",
