Cron expressions are used to schedule tasks based on time. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each field in a cron expression:

Field          Description                      Meaning
*              Minute                            The job will run at every minute.
*              Hour                              The job will run at every hour.
*              Day of Month                      The job will run every day of the month.
*              Month                             The job will run every month of the year.
2,5            Day of Week                       The job will run on specified days of the week.

Notes:
- `*` means "every" or "any" value for that field.
- Numbers specify specific values.
- Lists (e.g., `2,5`) specify multiple values.
- Ranges and other special characters can be used for more complex schedules.
